Anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been limited by small samples or measurement of single brain regions. Since the neuropsychological deficits in ADHD implicate a network linking basal ganglia and frontal regions, 12 subcortical and cortical regions and their symmetries were measured to determine if these structures best distinguished ADHD.
Method:
Anatomic brain MRIs for 57 boys with ADHD and 55 healthy matched controls, aged 5 to 18 years, were obtained using a 1.5-T scanner with contiguous 2-mm sections. Volumetric measures of the cerebrum, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, amygdala, hippocampus, temporal lobe, cerebellum; a measure of prefrontal cortex; and related right-left asymmetries were examined along with midsagittal area measures of the cerebellum and corpus callosum.

To improve the stealthiness of MTD, we propose a hidden MTD approach that cannot be detected by the attackers and prove its equivalence to an MTD that maintains the power flows of the whole grid. Moreover, we analyze the completeness of MTD and show that any hidden MTD is incomplete in that FDI attacks may bypass the hidden MTD opportunistically. This result suggests that the stealthiness and completeness are …"

As a result, the sensing performance of a wireless sensor network is inevitably undermined by biases in imperfect sensor hardware and the noises in data measurements.

Onto this latent feature space, we project the data in related domains where we can apply standard learning algorithms to train classification or regression models. Thus, the latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new dimensionality reduction method to find a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions of the data in different domains in a latent space.

In situations where the training data in a target domain are not sufficient to learn predictive models effectively, transfer learning leverages auxiliary source data from other related source domains for learning. While most of the existing works in this area only focused on using the source data with the same structure as the target data, in this paper, we push this boundary further by proposing a heterogeneous transfer learning framework for knowledge transfer between text and images. We observe that for a target-domain classification problem, some annotated images can be found on many social Web sites, which can serve as a bridge to transfer knowledge from the abundant text documents available over the Web. A key question is how to effectively transfer the knowledge in the source data even though the text can be arbitrarily found. Our solution is to enrich the representation of the target images with semantic concepts extracted from the auxiliary source data through a novel matrix factorization method. By using the latent semantic features generated by the auxiliary data, we are able to build a better integrated image classifier. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on the Caltech-256 image dataset."

One crucial research issue in transfer learning is how to find a good representation for instances of different domains such that the divergence between domains can be reduced with the new representation.

However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the previous approaches neither minimize the difference between domains explicitly nor encode label information in learning the representation. In this paper, we propose a supervised representation learning method based on deep autoencoders for transfer learning. The proposed deep autoencoder consists of two encoding layers: an embedding layer and a label encoding layer. In the embedding layer, the distance in distributions of the embedded instances between the source and target domains is minimized in terms of KL-Divergence. In the label encoding layer, label information of the source domain is encoded using a softmax regression model.

In our proposed method, parameters of each individual layer are pruned independently based on second order derivatives of a layer-wise error function with respect to the corresponding parameters. We prove that the final prediction performance drop after pruning is bounded by a linear combination of the reconstructed errors caused at each layer.

We present a novel framework based on adversarial autoencoders to learn a generalized latent feature representation across domains for domain generalization. To be specific, we extend adversarial autoencoders by imposing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to align the distributions among different domains, and matching the aligned distribution to an arbitrary prior distribution via adversarial feature learning. In this way, the learned feature representation is supposed to be universal to the seen source domains because of the MMD regularization, and is expected to generalize well on the target domain because of the introduction of the prior distribution.

The proposed model provides an end-to-end solution and does not require any parsers or other linguistic resources for preprocessing. Specifically, the proposed model is a multi-layer attention network, where each layer consists of a couple of attentions with tensor operators. One attention is for extracting aspect terms, while the other is for extracting opinion terms. They are learned interactively to dually propagate information between aspect terms and opinion terms.

In a WiFi environment, a mobile device can be localized using signals received from various transmitters, such as access points (APs). Most localization approaches build a map between the signal space and the physical location space in a offline phase, and then using the received-signal-strength (RSS) map to estimate the location in an online phase. However, the map can be outdated when the signal-strength values change with time due to environmental dynamics. It is infeasible or expensive to repeat data calibration for reconstructing the RSS map. In such a case, it is important to adapt the model learnt in one time period to another time period without too much recalibration. In this paper, we present a location-estimation approach based on Manifold co-Regularization, which is a machine learning technique for building a mapping function between data. We describe LeManCoR, a system for adapting the mapping function between the signal space and physical location space over different time periods based on Manifold Co-Regularization.

Supervised learning classifiers often misclassify tweets containing conjunctions such as “but” and conditionals such as “if”, due to their special linguistic characteristics. These classifiers also assign a decision score very close to the decision boundary for a large number tweets, which suggests that they are simply unsure instead of being completely wrong about these tweets. To counter these two challenges, this paper proposes a system that enhances supervised learning for polarity classification by leveraging on linguistic rules and sentic computing resources.

Despite the implicit parallelism of population-based search, no attempt has yet been made to multitask, i.e., to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously using a single population of evolving individuals. Accordingly, this paper introduces evolutionary multitasking as a new paradigm in the field of optimization and evolutionary computation. We first formalize the concept of evolutionary multitasking and then propose an algorithm to handle such problems. The methodology is inspired by biocultural models of multifactorial inheritance, which explain the transmission of complex developmental traits to offspring through the interactions of genetic and cultural factors. Furthermore, we develop a cross-domain optimization platform that allows one to solve diverse problems concurrently …"

Towards that end, this paper presents PROTECT, a game-theoretic system deployed by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in the port of Boston for scheduling their patrols. USCG has termed the deployment of PROTECT in Boston a success, and efforts are underway to test it in the port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment. PROTECT is premised on an attacker-defender Stackelberg game model and offers five key innovations. First, this system is a departure from the assumption of perfect adversary rationality noted in previous work, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary’s behavior—to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of the QR model. Second, to improve PROTECT’s efficiency, we generate a compact representation of the defender’s strategy space, exploiting equivalence and dominance. Third, we show how to practically model a real maritime patrolling problem as a Stackelberg game. Fourth, our experimental results illustrate that PROTECT’s QR model more robustly handles real-world uncertainties than a perfect rationality model.

Resource allocation in these environments, where both providers and consumers are selfish agents, presents numerous challenges since the number of consumers and their resource demand is highly dynamic. While numerous auction-based approaches have been proposed in the literature, this paper explores an alternative approach where providers and consumers automatically negotiate resource leasing contracts. Since resource demand and supply can be dynamic and uncertain, we propose a distributed negotiation mechanism where agents negotiate over both a contract price and a decommitment penalty, which allows agents to decommit from contracts at a cost. We compare our approach experimentally, using representative scenarios and workloads, to both combinatorial auctions and the fixed-price model used by Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud, and show that the negotiation model achieves a higher social welfare."

The challenge of the problem lies in the difficulty to effectively learn POI sequential transition and user preference, and integrate them for prediction. In this work, we propose a new latent representation model POI2Vec that is able to incorporate the geographical influence, which has been shown to be very important in modeling user mobility behavior. Note that existing representation models fail to incorporate the geographical influence. We further propose a method to jointly model the user preference and POI sequential transition influence for predicting potential visitors for a given POI.

This paper reports on PAWS’s significant evolution from a proposed decision aid to a regularly deployed application, reporting on the lessons from the first tests in Africa in Spring 2014, through its continued evolution since then, to current regular use in Southeast Asia and plans for future worldwide deployment. In this process, we have worked closely with two NGOs (Panthera and Rimba) and incorporated extensive feedback from professional patrolling teams. We outline key technical advances that lead to PAWS’s regular deployment:(i) incorporating complex topographic features, eg, ridgelines, in generating patrol routes;(ii) handling uncertainties in species distribution (game theoretic payoffs);(iii) ensuring scalability for patrolling large-scale conservation areas with fine-grained guidance; and (iv) handling complex patrol scheduling constraints."

In accordance with the standard game-theoretic model of Stackelberg games, past work has typically assumed that the attacker has perfect knowledge of the defender's randomized strategy and will react correspondingly.

Second, for important subclasses of security games, it identifies situations where we will face such multiple equilibria.

Nevertheless, like any open system that involves the exchange of things of value, selfish and malicious behaviors exist in crowdsourcing systems and need to be mitigated. Trust management has been proven to be a viable solution in many systems. However, a major difference between crowdsourcing systems and existing trust models designed for multi-agent systems is that human trustees have limited task processing capacity per unit time compared to an intelligent agent program. This paper recognizes a problem in current trust-aware decision-making methods for task assignment in crowdsourcing platforms. On the one hand, trust-based methods over-assign tasks to trusted workers, while on the other hand, workload-based solutions do not give sufficient guarantees on the quality of work. The proposed solution, the social welfare optimizing reputation-aware decision-making (SWORD) approach, strikes a balance between the two and is shown through extensive simulations to significantly improve social welfare of crowdsourcing platforms compared to related work."

These resource allocation strategies are randomized to prevent a strategic attacker from using surveillance to learn and exploit patterns in the allocation. Past work has typically assumed that the attacker has perfect knowledge of the defender’s randomized strategy or can learn the defender’s strategy after conducting a fixed period of surveillance. In consideration of surveillance cost, these assumptions are clearly simplistic since attackers may act with partial knowledge of the defender’s strategies and may dynamically decide whether to attack or conduct more surveillance. In this paper, we propose a natural model of limited surveillance in which the attacker dynamically determine a place to stop surveillance in consideration of his updated belief based on observed actions and surveillance cost. We show an upper bound on the maximum number of observations the attacker can make and show that the attacker’s optimal stopping problem can be formulated as a finite state space MDP. We give mathematical programs to compute optimal attacker and defender strategies. We compare our approaches with the best known previous solutions and experimental results show that the defender can achieve significant improvement in expected utility by taking the attacker’s optimal stopping decision into account, validating the motivation of our work."

In traditional Stackelberg security game models the attacker knows only the probability that each target is covered by the defender, but is oblivious to the detailed timing of the coverage schedule. In many real-world situations, however, the attacker can observe the current location of the defender and can exploit this knowledge to reason about the defender’s future moves. We show that this general modeling framework can be captured using adversarial patrolling games (APGs) in which the defender sequentially moves between targets, with moves constrained by a graph, while the attacker can observe the defender’s current location and his (stochastic) policy concerning future moves. We offer a very general model of infinite-horizon discounted adversarial patrolling games. Our first contribution is to show that defender policies that condition only on the previous defense move (ie, Markov stationary policies) can be arbitrarily suboptimal for general APGs. We then offer a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) formulation for computing optimal randomized policies for the defender that can condition on history of bounded, but arbitrary, length, as well as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to approximate these, with provable quality guarantees.

Trusters evaluate the reputation of trustees based on their past observed performance, and use this information to guide their future interaction decisions. Existing trust models tend to concentrate trusters’ interactions on a small number of highly reputable trustees to minimize risk exposure. When a trustee’s servicing capacity is limited, such an approach may cause long delays for trusters and subsequently damage the reputation of trustees. To mitigate this problem, we propose a reputation management approach for trustee agents based on distributed constraint optimization. It helps a trustee to make situation-aware decisions on which incoming requests to serve and prevent the resulting reputation score from being affected by factors out of the trustee’s control. The approach is evaluated through theoretical analysis and within a simulated, highly dynamic multi-agent environment. The results show that it can achieve close to optimally efficient utilization of the trustee agents’ collective capacity in an ODMAS, promotes fair treatment of trustee agents based on their behavior, and significantly outperforms related work in enhancing social welfare."

It is thus necessary to do a detailed comparison of these approaches to choose the optimal quality map and guiding strategy. For quality maps, in the presence of noise, transform-based methods are found to be the best choice. However in the presence of discontinuities, phase unwrapping is itself unresolved and hence quality-guided phase unwrapping is not sufficient. For guiding strategies, classical, two-section, and stack-chain guiding strategies are chosen for comparison. If accuracy is the foremost criterion then the classical guiding strategy with a data structure of indexed interwoven linked list is best. If speed is of essence then the stack-chain guiding strategy is the one to use."

More precisely, the regularization model is based on the dual formulation of the vectorial Total Variation (VTV) norm and it may be regarded as the vectorial extension of the dual approach defined by Chambolle in [13] for gray-scale/scalar images. The proposed model offers several advantages. First, it minimizes the exact VTV norm whereas standard approaches use a regularized norm. Then, the numerical scheme of minimization is straightforward to implement and finally, the number of iterations to reach the solution is low, which gives a fast regularization algorithm. Finally, and maybe more importantly, the proposed VTV minimization scheme can be easily extended to many standard applications. We apply this L1 vectorial regularization algorithm to the following problems: color inverse scale space, color denoising with the chromaticity-brightness color representation, color image inpainting, color wavelet shrinkage, color image decomposition, color image deblurring, and color denoising on manifolds. Generally speaking, this VTV minimization scheme can be used in problems that required vector field (color, other feature vector) regularization while preserving discontinuities.

Although the problem under the standard low rank assumption is NP-hard, Candès and Recht showed that it can be exactly relaxed if the number of observed entries is sufficiently large. In this work, we introduce a novel matrix completion model that makes use of proximity information about rows and columns by assuming they form communities. This assumption makes sense in several real-world problems like in recommender systems, where there are communities of people sharing preferences, while products form clusters that receive similar ratings. Our main goal is thus to find a low-rank solution that is structured by the proximities of rows and columns encoded by graphs. We borrow ideas from manifold learning to constrain our solution to be smooth on these graphs, in order to implicitly force row and column proximities. Our matrix recovery model is formulated as a convex non-smooth optimization problem, for which a well-posed iterative scheme is provided. We study and evaluate the proposed matrix completion on synthetic and real data, showing that the proposed structured low-rank recovery model outperforms the standard matrix completion model in many situations."

The fiber segmentation is carried out with a front propagation algorithm constructed to fill the whole fiber tract. The front is a 3D surface that evolves with a propagation speed proportional to a measure indicating the similarity of diffusion between the tensors lying on the surface and their neighbors in the direction of propagation. We use a level set implementation to assure a stable and accurate evolution of the surface and to handle changes of topology of the surface during the evolution process. The fiber tract segmentation method does not need a regularized tensor field since the surface is automatically smoothed as it propagates. The …"

Still it is highly sensitive to outliers and does not scale well with respect to the number of data samples. Robust PCA solves the first issue with a sparse penalty term. The second issue can be handled with the matrix factorization model, which is however non-convex. Besides, PCA based clustering can also be enhanced by using a graph of data similarity. In this article, we introduce a new model called'Robust PCA on Graphs' which incorporates spectral graph regularization into the Robust PCA framework. Our proposed model benefits from 1) the robustness of principal components to occlusions and missing values, 2) enhanced low-rank recovery, 3) improved clustering property due to the graph smoothness assumption on the low-rank matrix, and 4) convexity of the resulting optimization problem. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmark, 3 video and 2 artificial datasets with corruptions clearly reveal that our model outperforms 10 other state-of-the-art models in its clustering and low-rank recovery tasks."

However, despite its high flexibility, the original level set method is limited by two important numerical issues. First, the level set method does not implicitly preserve the level set function as a distance function, which is necessary to estimate accurately geometric features, s.a. the curvature or the contour normal. Second, the level set algorithm is slow because the time step is limited by the standard Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which is also essential to the numerical stability of the iterative scheme.

The main solution concept there is the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE), which optimizes the defender's random allocation of limited security resources. However, solely deploying the SSE mixed strategy has limitations. In the extreme case, there are security games where the defender is able to defend all the assets``almost perfectly"" at the SSE, but she still sustains significant loss. In this paper, we propose an approach for improving the defender's utility in such scenarios. Perhaps surprisingly, our approach is to strategically reveal to the attacker information about the sampled pure strategy. Specifically, we propose a two-stage security game model, where in the first stage the defender allocates resources and the attacker selects a target to attack, and in the second stage the defender strategically reveals local information about that target, potentially deterring the attacker's attack plan. We then study how the defender can play optimally in both stages. We show, theoretically and experimentally, that the two-stage security game model allows the defender to gain strictly better utility than SSE."

In particular, we use an extended persuasion model, where the Sender’s information is imperfect and the Receiver has more than two alternative actions available. We design a computational algorithm that, from the Sender’s standpoint, calculates the optimal information disclosure rule.

Such procedures are defined by a voting rule and a (restricted) iterative process, where at each step one agent can modify his vote towards a better outcome for himself. It is already known that if the iteration dynamics (the manner in which voters are allowed to modify their votes) are unrestricted, then the voting process may not converge. For most common voting rules this may be observed even under the best response dynamics limitation. It is therefore important to investigate whether and which natural restrictions on the dynamics of iterative voting procedures can guarantee convergence. To this end, we provide two general conditions on the dynamics based on iterative myopic improvements, each of which is sufficient for convergence. We then identify several classes of voting rules (including Positional Scoring Rules, Maximin, Copeland and Bucklin), along with their corresponding iterative processes, for which at least one of these conditions hold."

This problem arises in many real world applications such as route selection systems and office assistants. To succeed in such settings agents must reason about how their actions in the present influence people's future actions. This work models such settings as a family of repeated bilateral games of incomplete information called``choice selection processes'', in which players may share certain goals, but are essentially self-interested. The paper describes several possible models of human behavior that were inspired by behavioral economic theories of people's play in repeated interactions. These models were incorporated into several agent designs to repeatedly generate offers to people playing the game. These agents were evaluated in extensive empirical investigations including hundreds of subjects that interacted with computers in different choice selections processes. The results revealed that an agent that combined a hyperbolic discounting model of human behavior with a social utility function was able to outperform alternative agent designs, including an agent that approximated the optimal strategy using continuous MDPs and an agent using epsilon-greedy strategies to describe people's behavior. We show that this approach was able to generalize to new people as well as choice selection processes that were not used for training. Our results demonstrate that combining computational approaches with behavioral economics models of people in repeated interactions facilitates the …"

The model combines both the features of the Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs) model and of the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) model. More specifically, SASI includes: a) an uncontrolled, exogenous security state that serves as the Defender’s private information; b) multiple security assets with non-accumulating, targetlocal defence capability; c) a pro-active, verifiable and public, unidirectional information disclosure channel from the Defender to the Attacker. We show that SASI with a non-degenerate information disclosure can be arbitrarily more efficient, than a “silent” Stackelberg assets allocation. We also provide a linear program reformulation of SASI that can be solved in polynomial time in SASI parameters. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to remove one of SASI parameters and, rather than require it as an input, recover it by computation. As a result, SASI becomes highly scalable."

Our focus is on providing a better understanding regarding the set of equilibria attainable by iterative voting processes. We start with the basic model of plurality voting. We first establish some useful properties of equilibria, reachable by iterative voting, which enable us to show that deciding whether a given profile is an iteratively reachable equilibrium is NP-complete. We then proceed to combine iterative voting with the concept of truth bias, a model where voters prefer to be truthful when they cannot affect the outcome. We fully characterise the set of attainable truth-biased equilibria, and show that it is possible to determine all such equilibria in polynomial time. Finally, we also examine the model of lazy voters, in which a voter may choose to abstain from the election. We establish convergence of the iterative process, albeit not necessarily to a Nash equilibrium. As in the case with truth bias, we also provide a polynomial time algorithm to find all the attainable equilibria."

The advisor agent’s interests may conflict with the interests of the people who receive the advice. Such optimization settings arise in many human-computer applications in which agents and people are self-interested but also share certain goals, such as automatic route-selection systems that also reason about environmental costs. This paper presents an agent that clusters people into one of several types, based on how their path selection behavior adheres to the paths presented to them by the agent who does not necessarily suggest their most preferred paths. It predicts the likelihood that people deviate from these suggested paths and uses a decision theoretic approach to suggest paths to people which will maximize the agent’s expected benefit given the people’s deviations. This technique was evaluated empirically in an extensive study involving hundreds of human subjects solving the path selection problem in mazes. Results showed that the agent was able to outperform alternative methods that solely considered the benefit to the agent or the person, or did not provide any advice."

In this paper, we tackle the problem of computing equilibria in such games with {\it continuous player types}, extending the framework to encompass settings with imperfect information. In particular, given the existence result for pure Bayes-Nash equilibiria in these games, we generalise the {\it fictitious play algorithm} by developing a novel procedure for finding a best response strategy, which is specifically designed to deal with continuous and, therefore, infinite type spaces. We then combine the best response computation with the general fictitious play structure to obtain an equilibrium. To illustrate the power of this approach, we apply our algorithm to the domain of simultaneous auctions with continuous private values and discrete bids, in which the algorithm shows quick convergence."

Such partial observation of the deployed pure strategy--an issue we refer to as information leakage--is a significant concern in practical applications. While previous research on patrolling games has considered the attacker's real-time surveillance, our settings, therefore models and techniques, are fundamentally different. More specifically, after describing the information leakage model, we start with an LP formulation to compute the defender's optimal strategy in the presence of leakage. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that a key subproblem to solve this LP (more precisely, the defender oracle) is NP-hard even for the simplest of security game models. We then approach the problem from three possible directions: efficient algorithms for restricted cases, approximation algorithms, and heuristic algorithms for sampling that improves upon the status quo.

While such polls can be captured by the standard models of Approval voting, Zou et al. [18] analyse real-life Doodle poll data and conclude that poll participants' behaviour seems to be affected by considerations other than their intrinsic preferences over the alternatives. To capture this phenomenon, they propose a model of social voting, where voters approve their top alternatives as well as additional 'safe' choices so as to appear cooperative. The predictions of this model turn out to be consistent with the real-life data. However, Zou et al. do not attempt to rationalise the voters' behaviour in the context of social voting: They explicitly describe the voters' strategies rather than explain how these strategies arise from voters' preferences. In this paper, we complement the work of Zou et al. by putting forward a model in which the behaviour described by Zou et al. arises as an equilibrium strategy. In our model, a voter derives a bonus from approving each additional alternative, up to a certain cap. We show that trembling hand perfect Nash equilibria of our model behave consistently with the model of Zou et al. Importantly, placing a cap on the total bonus is an essential component of our model: in the absence of the cap, all Nash equilibria are very far from the behaviour observed in Doodle polls."

In the context of Stackelberg games, various approaches have been proposed to deal with the leader's incomplete knowledge about the follower's payoffs, typically by gathering information from the leader's interaction with the follower. Unfortunately, these approaches rely crucially on the assumption that the follower will not strategically exploit this information asymmetry, ie, the follower behaves truthfully during the interaction according to their actual payoffs. As we show in this paper, the follower may have strong incentives to deceitfully imitate the behavior of a different follower type and, in doing this, benefit significantly from inducing the leader into choosing a highly suboptimal strategy.

Focusing on games under Plurality, we extend the standard model to allow for situations where voters may refuse to return their votes to those candidates who had previously left the election, should they decide to run again. We show that if at the time when a candidate withdraws his candidacy, with some positive probability each voter takes this candidate out of his future consideration, the process converges with probability 1. This is in sharp contrast with the original model where the very existence of a Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed. We then consider the two extreme cases of this setting, where voters may block a withdrawn candidate with probabilities 0 or 1. In these scenarios, we study the complexity of reaching equilibria from a given initial point, converging to an equilibrium with a predermined winner or to an equilibrium with a given set of running candidates.

Most of the existing systems are centrally controlled hence raising scalability issues and single points of failure. In this paper we present a completely decentralized reputation scheme for P2P networks. The system is based on a certificate, RCert, which is a document that resides on a participating P2P node, which consists of information ratings collected from previous transactions with other peers. Central to the scheme is the concept of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), upon on which much of the mechanism is based. In order to facilitate updates of RCert certificates, we present two protocols, RCertP and RCertPX. RCertP does not prevent the node from using older copies of RCert. An extended version, RCertPX, solves this problem by keeping track of the latest timestamp."

However, there are situations where users or applications do need to know the sources from which a particular datum is drawn: for example, enforcement of intellectual property, evaluation of data quality or measurement of the timeliness of data. In this paper, we define attribution as the association of a value in the result of a query with the sources either from which the data was extracted or which contributed to the selection. Motivated by multisource querying, attribution has particular applicability in the context of the World Wide Web. After beginning with an example that both describes and motivates the need for attribution within the semi-structured environment of the Web, we offer a general attribution framework and algebra and discuss the implementation of a prototype."

Polycube splines are essentially a novel variant of manifold splines which are built upon the polycube map, serving as its parametric domain. Our rationale for defining spline surfaces over polycubes is that polycubes have rectangular structures everywhere over their domains, except a very small number of corner points. The boundary of polycubes can be naturally decomposed into a set of regular structures, which facilitate tensor-product surface definition, GPU-centric geometric computing, and image-based geometric processing.

Among various methods for computing uniform superpixels, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) is popular due to its simplicity and high performance. In this paper, we extend SLIC to compute content-sensitive superpixels, ie, small superpixels in content-dense regions (eg, with high intensity or color variation) and large superpixels in content-sparse regions. Rather than the conventional SLIC method that clusters pixels in R5, we map the image I to a 2-dimensional manifold M in R5, whose area elements are a good measure of the content density in I. We propose an efficient method to compute restricted centroidal Voronoi tessellation (RCVT)---a uniform tessellation---on M, which induces the content-sensitive superpixels in I. Unlike other algorithms that characterize content-sensitivity by geodesic distances, manifold SLIC tackles the problem by measuring areas of Voronoi cells on M, which can be computed at a very low cost. As a result, it runs 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art content-sensitive superpixels algorithm. We evaluate manifold SLIC and seven representative methods on the BSDS500 benchmark and observe that our method outperforms the existing methods."

The modeled solid can be of complicated geometry and arbitrary topology. It is formulated using a trivariate simplex spline defined over a tetrahedral decomposition of any 3D domain. Heterogeneous material attributes associated with solid geometry can be modeled and edited by manipulating the control vectors and/or associated knots of trivariate simplex splines easily. The multiresolution capability is achieved by interactively subdividing any regions of interest and allocating more knots and control vectors accordingly. We also develop a feature-sensitive fitting algorithm that can reconstruct a more compact, continuous trivariate simplex spline from structured or unstructured volumetric grids. This multiresolution representation results from the adaptive and progressive tetrahedralization of the 3D domain. In addition, based on the simplex spline theory, we derive several theoretical formula and propose a fast direct rendering algorithm for interactive data analysis and visualization of the simplex spline volumes. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm augments the current modeling and visualization techniques with the new and unique advantages.

However, there is still no robust software that is capable to generate such meshes with good quality. In this paper, we present a Delaunay-based surface triangulation algorithm generating quality surface meshes for the molecular skin model. We expand the restricted union of balls along the surface and generate an ε-sampling of the skin surface incrementally. At the same time, a quality surface mesh is extracted from the Delaunay triangulation of the sample points. The algorithm supports robust and efficient implementation and guarantees the mesh quality and topology as well.

Our technique generally involves a personality adaptation module encapsulated in a reinforcement learning framework. Unlike previous work in which adaptation normally involves a decision process on every single action the agent takes, we introduce a two-level process whereby adaptation only takes place on an abstracted actions set which we coin as agent personality. With the personality defined, each agent will then take actions according to the restrictions imposed in its personality. In doing so, adaptation takes place in appropriately defined intervals in the game, without disrupting or slowing down the game constantly with intensive decision-making computations, hence improving enjoyment for the player. Moreover, by decoupling adaptation from action selection, we have a modular adaptive system that can be used with existing action planning methods. With an actual typical game scenario that we have created, it is shown that a team of agents using our framework to adapt towards the player are able to perform better than a team with scripted behavior. Consequently, we also show the team performs even better when adapted towards each other."

With this concept, the IMPLANT architecture extracts both a POMDP and MDP abstract model from the underlying game world. The abstract action policies are then pre-computed from each model and merged into a single optimal policy. Coupled with a small amount of online learning, the architecture is able to adapt both the player and the game environment in plausible pre-computation and query times.

This produces a personality representation of much higher expressive power that improves the adaptation performance and subsequently enables a larger variety of action genres to be adaptable. A TAP-based learning framework is then constructed and it is shown to perform better than the one based on the previous agent personality. Consequently, we also implement an RPG scenario that demonstrates its ability to generate adaptive plausible behavior in a much larger variety of action genres."

Compared to the traditional methods of molecular surface representations (e.g., the solvent exclusive surface), MSS has distinctive advantages including having no self-intersection and being decomposable and transformable. For further promoting MSS to the field of bioinformatics, transformation between different MSS representations mimicking the macromolecular dynamics is demanded. The transformation process helps biologists understand the macromolecular dynamics processes visually in the atomic level, which is important in studying the protein structures and binding sites for optimizing drug design. However, modeling the transformation between different MSSs suffers from high computational cost while the traditional approaches reconstruct every intermediate MSS from respective intermediate union of balls. In this study, we propose a novel computational framework named general MSS transformation framework (GMSSTF) between two MSSs without the assistance of union of balls. To evaluate the effectiveness of GMSSTF, we applied it on a popular public database PDB (Protein Data Bank) and compared the existing MSS algorithms with and without GMSSTF. The simulation results show that the proposed GMSSTF effectively improves the computational efficiency and is potentially useful for macromolecular dynamic simulations."

In this paper, we show how safety policies of programs can be analysed by tracking size properties of objects and be enforced by objects' invariants and the preconditions of methods. We propose several new ideas to allow both mutability and sharing of objects, whilst aiming for precision in our analysis. We introduce the concept of size-immutability to facilitate sharing, and also a set of alias controls to track unaliased objects whose size properties may change. We formalise our results through a set of advanced type checking …"

While versatile, these schemes are of limited practical use on their own. A key problem is that the more natural sequential specifications may not have associative combine operators required by these schemes. As a result, they often fail to be immediately identified. To resolve this problem, the authors propose a method to systematically derive parallel programs from sequential definitions. This method is special in that it can automatically invent auxiliary functions needed by associative combine operators. Apart from a formalisation, they also provide new theorems, based on the notion of context preservation, to guarantee parallelization for a precise class of sequential programs."

We then solve these assumptions with case analysis to determine the (conditional) termination and non-termination scenarios expressed in some specification logic form. In contrast to current approaches, our technique can construct a summary of terminating and non-terminating behaviors for each method.

Our solution does not require changing the LBS server architecture and does not assume third party servers; yet, it significantly improves users' location privacy. The gain stems from the collaboration of mobile devices: they keep their context information in a buffer and pass it to others seeking such information. Thus, a user remains hidden from the server, unless all the collaborative peers in the vicinity lack the sought information.

The unraveling of the scheme unfolds the inconsistency between its components, mainly the cloaking mechanism and the k-anonymity metric. We show that constructing cloaking regions based on the users' locations does not reliably relate to location privacy, and argue that this technique may even be detrimental to users' location privacy.

Data obfuscation is a prevalent user-centric approach to protecting users’ privacy in such systems: the untrusted entity only receives a noisy version of user’s data. Perturbing data before sharing it, however, comes at the price of the users’ utility (service quality) experience which is an inseparable design factor of obfuscation mechanisms. The entanglement of the utility loss and the privacy guarantee, in addition to the lack of a comprehensive notion of privacy, have led to the design of obfuscation mechanisms that are either suboptimal in terms of their utility loss, or ignore the user’s information leakage in the past, or are limited to very specific notions of privacy which e.g., do not protect against adaptive inference attacks or the adversary with arbitrary background knowledge.
In this paper, we design user-centric obfuscation mechanisms that impose the minimum utility loss for guaranteeing user’s privacy. We optimize utility subject to a joint guarantee of differential privacy (indistinguishability) and distortion privacy (inference error). This double shield of protection limits the information leakage through obfuscation mechanism as well as the posterior inference. We show that the privacy achieved through joint differential-distortion mechanisms against optimal attacks is as large as the maximum privacy that can be achieved by either of these mechanisms separately. Their utility cost is also not larger than what either of the differential or distortion mechanisms imposes. We model the optimization problem as a …"

On the one hand, many of the popular techniques such as data de-identification are problematic because of their dependence on the background knowledge of adversaries. On the other hand, rigorous methods such as the exponential mechanism for differential privacy are often computationally impractical to use for releasing high dimensional data or cannot preserve high utility of original data due to their extensive data perturbation.
This paper presents a criterion called plausible deniability that provides a formal privacy guarantee, notably for releasing sensitive datasets: an output record can be released only if a certain amount of input records are indistinguishable, up to a privacy parameter. This notion does not depend on the background knowledge of an adversary. Also, it can efficiently be checked by privacy tests. We present mechanisms to generate synthetic datasets with similar statistical properties to the input data and the same format. We study this technique both theoretically and experimentally. A key theoretical result shows that, with proper randomization, the plausible deniability mechanism generates differentially private synthetic data. We demonstrate the efficiency of this generative technique on a large dataset; it is shown to preserve the utility of original data with respect to various statistical analysis and machine learning measures."

Second, in keeping with how many existing ML-as-a-service platforms work, Chiron reveals neither the training algorithm nor the model structure to the user, providing only black-box access to the trained model. Chiron is implemented using SGX enclaves, but SGX alone does not achieve the dual goals of data privacy and model confidentiality. Chiron runs the standard ML training toolchain (including the popular Theano framework and C compiler) in an enclave, but the untrusted model-creation code from the service operator is further confined in a Ryoan sandbox to prevent it from leaking the training data outside the enclave. To support distributed training, Chiron executes multiple concurrent enclaves that exchange model parameters via a parameter server.

To drive near pedestrians safely, efficiently, and smoothly, autonomous vehicles must estimate unknown pedestrian intentions and hedge against the uncertainty in intention estimates in order to choose actions that are effective and robust. A key feature of our approach is to use the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for systematic, robust decision making under uncertainty. Although there are concerns about the potentially high computational complexity of POMDP planning, experiments show that our POMDP-based planner runs in near real time, at 3 Hz, on a robot golf cart in a complex, dynamic environment. This indicates that POMDP planning is improving fast in computational efficiency and becoming increasingly practical as a tool for robot planning under uncertainty."

The bridge test can be implemented efficiently in high-dimensional configuration spaces using only simple tests of local geometry. The strengths of the bridge test and uniform sampling complement each other naturally. The two sampling strategies are combined to construct the hybrid sampling strategy for our planner.

Inspired by probabilistic-roadmap (PRM) techniques, the planner samples the state x time space of a robot by picking control inputs at random in order to compute a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the space. However, the planner does not precompute a roadmap as most PRM planners do. Instead, for each planning query, it generates, on the fly, a small roadmap that connects the given initial and goal state. In contrast to PRM planners, the roadmap computed by our algorithm is a directed graph oriented along the time axis of the space. To verify the planner's effectiveness in practice, we tested it both in simulated environments containing many moving obstacles and on a real …"

This thesis presents efficient randomized algorithms for singlequery motion planning of objects with many dofs and under complex motion constraints. Unlike most other probabilistic roadmap planners, our algorithms perform no preprocessing of the environment. They sample collision-free configurations incrementally in the connected components of the space that contain the query configurations, thus avoiding the high cost of pre-computing a roadmap for the entire space. Two specific planners are discussed. One addresses the simpler problem of path planning. The other extends the basic idea and takes into account kinematic and dynamic constraints on motion as well. A control system is used to represent both types of constraints in a unified framework. Our algorithms have been tested extensively on both synthesized examples and real-life CAD data from the industry; they have shown strong performance on rigid-body and articulated objects with up to 18 dofs. We also demonstrate their generality and effectiveness in three practical applications: assembly maintainability checking, motion synthesis for animated characters, and kinodynamic motion planning for an integrated real-time robot system in environments with moving obstacles.

Existing visual attention models are generally spatial, ie, the attention is modeled as spatial probabilities that re-weight the last conv-layer feature map of a CNN encoding an input image. However, we argue that such spatial attention does not necessarily conform to the attention mechanism---a dynamic feature extractor that combines contextual fixations over time, as CNN features are naturally spatial, channel-wise and multi-layer. In this paper, we introduce a novel convolutional neural network dubbed SCA-CNN that incorporates Spatial and Channel-wise Attentions in a CNN. In the task of image captioning, SCA-CNN dynamically modulates the sentence generation context in multi-layer feature maps, encoding where (ie, attentive spatial locations at multiple layers) and what (ie, attentive channels) the visual attention is. We evaluate the proposed SCA-CNN architecture on three benchmark image captioning datasets: Flickr8K, Flickr30K, and MSCOCO.

We treat this process as an integral operator and analyze its kernel. This kernel is dominated by its diagonal in the wavelet bases and thus permits a fast algorithm for foveating images. In addition, the transformed kernel takes a simple form which can be easily computed using a look-up table. This is useful, since in applications the fovea changes rapidly.

This is achieved by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) on the spectrogram, followed by an iterated application of independent component analysis (ICA) on the principle components. The SVD contributes to the separability of each component and the ICA contributes to the independence of the two components.

We study techniques for ensuring privacy preserving computation in the popular MapReduce framework. In this paper, we first show that protecting only individual units of distributed computation (eg map and reduce units), as proposed in recent works, leaves several important channels of information leakage exposed to the adversary. Next, we analyze a variety of design choices in achieving a stronger notion of private execution that is the analogue of using a distributed oblivious-RAM (ORAM) across the platform. We develop a simple solution which avoids using the expensive ORAM construction, and incurs only an additive logarithmic factor of overhead to the latency. We implement our solution in a system called M 2 R, which enhances an existing Hadoop implementation, and evaluate it on seven standard MapReduce benchmarks. We show that it is easy to port most existing applications to M 2 R by changing fewer than 43 lines of code. M 2 R adds fewer than 500 lines of code to the TCB, which is less than 0: 16% of the Hadoop codebase. M 2 R offers a factor of 1: 3x to 44: 6x lower overhead than extensions of previous solutions with equivalent privacy.

Firstly, we analyse roles of the sources of randomness, namely the explicit randomness induced by the noise distribution and the implicit randomness induced by the data-generation distribution, that are involved in the design of a privacy-preserving mechanism. The finer analysis enables us to provide stronger privacy guarantees with quantifiable risks. Thus, we propose privacy at risk that is a probabilistic calibration of privacy-preserving mechanisms. We provide a composition theorem that leverages privacy at risk. We instantiate the probabilistic calibration for the Laplace mechanism by providing analytical results.
Secondly, we propose a cost model that bridges the gap between the privacy level and the compensation budget estimated by a GDPR compliant business entity. The convexity of the proposed cost model leads to a unique fine-tuning of privacy level that minimises the compensation budget. We show its effectiveness by illustrating a realistic scenario that avoids overestimation of the compensation budget by using privacy at risk for the Laplace mechanism.

Every farmer was given a copy of the clay token that was used for sealing his earthen pot. In the following year, the farmers used to go back to Ziggurat to claim their own share of the seed grains by matching their tokens with tokens on the sealed pots.

However, in some cases, the rejection sampling approach runs slowly. Therefore, we also propose another approach. The approach works by using a heuristic to find a good …"

Its mining algorithms discover all item associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf) constraints. Minsup controls the minimum number of data cases that a rule must cover. Minconf controls the predictive strength of the rule. Since only one minsup is used for the whole database, the model implicitly assumes that all items in the data are of the same nature and/or have similar frequencies in the data. This is, however, seldom the case in reallife applications. In many applications, some items appear very frequently in the data, while others rarely appear. If minsup is set too high, those rules that involve rare items will not be found. To find rules that involve both frequent and rare items, minsup has to be set very low.

The huge number of associations makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for a human user to analyze in order to identify those interesting/useful ones.

We introduce XClust, a novel integration strategy that involves the clustering of DTDs.

Whether a rule is of interest to a user depends on his/her existing knowledge of the domain, and his/her interests. In this paper, we propose a technique that analyzes the discovered rules against a specific type of existing knowledge, which we call general impressions, to help the user identify interesting rules. We first propose a representation language to allow general impressions to be specified.

This paper proposes a generalized bottom-up update strategy for R-trees. This strategy is motivated by the class of monitoring applications, which are characterized by large volumes of updates, and the increasingly important role of indexing. This update strategy can easily be applied to the members of the family of R-tree-based indexing techniques, as it preserves the index structure and takes into account concurrency control. The strategy improves the robustness of R-trees by supporting different levels of index reorganization—ranging from local to global—during updates, thus using expensive top-down updates only when necessary. This chapter presents a compact main-memory summary structure along with efficient bottom-up algorithms that reduce the numbers of disk accesses and CPU resources used for update and querying.

From pre vious analyses, the Transmission-Gate Pulsed Latch (TGPL) proved to be the most energy-efficient FF in a large portion of the design space, ranging from high speed (minimizing ED' products with j>;1) to minimum ED product designs, while simple Master-Slave FFs (TGFF and ACFF ) are the most energy-efficient in the low-power E-D space region. TGPL also has the lowest D Q delay along with STFF. However, the latter has considerably worse energy efficiency, hence, the TGPL is the best reference for a comparison.

More precisely, we simulated various vehicle circuits, ranging from ring oscillators to mirror full adders, to investigate the effectiveness of back biasing and transistor-stacking in both FinFETs and bulk MOSFETs. The opportunity to separate the gates of FinFETs and to operate them independently has been systematically analyzed; mixed connected- and independent-gate circuits have also been evaluated. The study spans over the device, the layout, and the circuit level of abstraction and appropriate figures of merit are introduced to quantify the potential advantage of different schemes.

In particular, the proposed design strategy is based on a feedback control procedure that allows to dynamically change the system parameters for the correction of the circuit ""nonidealities"" (e.g., the circuit offsets). The correction algorithm does not require a direct measurement of the system ""nonidealities"" or of the effective value of the map parameters, but only a dynamic estimation of these quantities based on the observation of the TRBG output.

It is an excellent tool for modeling data and algorithms, but its object semantics are single threaded and operations are atomic. Therefore, it is difficult to use Object-Z to capture the behaviour of concurrent real-time reactive systems. On the other hand, Timed CSP is good at modeling real-time concurrent behaviour, but has little support for modeling the state of a complex system. This paper introduces a blending of Object-Z and Timed CSP, known as TCOZ.

We use factor graphs and numerical optimization to perform inference quickly, and we show how GP interpolation can further increase the speed of the algorithm. Our framework also allows us to incrementally update the solution of the planning problem to contend with changing conditions. We benchmark our algorithm against several recent trajectory optimization algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that our approach is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness.

However, despite its intriguing properties, one of the biggest hurdles for graphene to be useful as an electronic material is the lack of an energy gap in its electronic spectra. This, for example, prevents the use of graphene in making transistors. Although several proposals have been made to open a gap in graphene’s electronic spectra, they all require complex engineering of the graphene layer. Here, we show that when graphene is epitaxially grown on SiC substrate, a gap of≈ 0.26 eV is produced. This gap decreases as the sample thickness increases and eventually approaches zero when the number of layers exceeds four. We propose that the origin of this gap is the breaking of sublattice symmetry owing to the graphene–substrate interaction. We believe that our results highlight a promising direction for …"

In order to present a consistent view of a complex world, these devices will need to maintain data objects with atomic (linearizable) read/write semantics.
Lynch and Shvartsman have recently developed a reconfigurable atomic read/write memory algorithm for such environments [12, 13] This algorithm, called RAMBO, guarantees atomicity for arbitrary patterns of asynchrony, message loss, and node crashes. RAMBO installs new configurations lazily, transferring data from old configurations to new configurations using a background information transfer task. That task handles configurations sequentially, transferring information from each configuration to the next. This paper presents a new algorithm, RAMBO II, that implements a radically different approach to installing new configurations: instead of operating sequentially, the new algorithm reconfigures"" aggressively"", transferring information from old configurations in parallel. This improvement substantially reduces the time necessary to remove obsolete configurations, which in turn substantially increases the fault-tolerance. This paper presents a formal specification of the new algorithm, a correctness proof, and a conditional analysis of its performance. Preliminary empirical studies performed using LAN implementations of RAMBO and the new algorithm illustrate the advantages of the new algorithm."

Etna correctly handles dynamically changing sets of replica hosts, and is optimized for reads, writes, and reconfiguration, in that order.Etna maintains a series of replica configurations as nodes in the system change, using new sets of replicas from the pool supplied by the distributed hash table system. It uses the Paxos protocol to ensure consensus on the members of each new configuration. For simplicity and performance, Etna serializes all reads and writes through a primary during the lifetime of each configuration. As a result, Etna completes read and write operations in only a single round from the primary.Experiments in an environment with high network delaysshow that Etna's read latency is determined by round-tripdelay in the underlying network, while write and reconfiguration latency is determined by the transmission time required to send data to each replica. Etna's write latency is about the same as that of a non-atomic replicating DHT, and Etna's read latency is about twice that of a non-atomic DHT due to Etna assembling a quorum for every read."

These mobile nodes can either act as mobile relays or mobile sinks. To investigate the performance of these two options and the trade-offs associated with these two options, we first consider a finite network. We then compute the lifetime for different routing algorithms for three cases (i) when the network is all static (ii) when there is one mobile sink and (iii) when there is one mobile relay. We find that using the mobile node as a sink results in the maximum improvement in lifetime. We contend however that in hostile terrains, it might not always be possible for the sink to be mobile. We then investigate the performance of a large dense network with one mobile relay and show that the improvement in network lifetime over an all …"

In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel …"

Most of the proposals in the literature only address certain aspects of the QoS support, e.g., QoS routing, QoS medium access control (MAC) and resource reservation. However, none of them proposes a QoS model for MANETs. Meanwhile, two QoS models have been proposed for the Internet, viz., the integrated services (IntServ) model and the differentiated services (DiffServ) model, but these models are aimed for wired networks. In this paper, we propose a flexible QoS model for MANETs (FQMM) which considers the characteristics of MANETs and combines the high quality QoS of IntServ and service differentiation of Diff-Serv. Salient features of FQMM include: dynamics roles of nodes, hybrid provisioning and adaptive conditioning. Preliminary simulation results show that FQMM achieves better performance in terms of …"

To meet the practical requirement that the energy receiver (ER) operates with significantly higher received power as compared to the conventional information receiver (IR), ERs need to be deployed in more proximity to the transmitter than IRs in the SWIPT system. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, one critical issue arises that the messages sent to IRs can be eavesdropped by ERs, which possess better channels from the transmitter. In this paper, we address this new physical-layer security problem in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where one multi-antenna transmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to an IR and multiple ERs, each with one single antenna.

Furthermore, the traffic from such applications are expected to be highly bursty in nature. For such traffic, the allocation of static fixed-bandwidth circuits may lead to the over-provisioning of bandwidth resources in order to meet QoS requirements. Optical burst switching (OBS) is a promising new technique which attempts to address the problem of efficiently allocating resources for bursty traffic. In OBS, incoming data is assembled into bursts at the edges of the network, and when the burst is ready to be sent, resources in the network are reserved only for the duration of the burst. The reservation of resources is typically made by an out-of-band one-way control message which precedes the burst by some offset time. By reserving resources only for the duration of the burst, a greater degree of utilization may be achieved in the network. This book provides an overview of optical burst switching. Design and research issues involved in the development of OBS networks are discussed, and approaches to providing QoS in OBS networks are presented.

We first study the performance of a large dense network with one mobile relay and show that network lifetime improves over that of a purely static network by up to a factor of four. Also, the mobile relay needs to stay only within a two-hop radius of the sink. We then construct a joint mobility and routing algorithm which can yield a network lifetime close to the upper bound.

We consider mobile sensors with limited mobility, ie, they can move only once over a short distance. Such mobiles are simple and cheap compared to sophisticated mobile robots. In conventional static sensor networks, for a random deployment, the sensor density should increase as O (log L+ k log log L) to provide k-coverage in a network with a size of L. As an alternative, an all mobile sensor network can provide k-coverage over the field with a constant density of O (k), independent of network size L. We show that the maximum distance that any mobile sensor will have to move is O (1 over√ k log 3 over 4 (kL)).

Current literature defines a point to be covered if it is within the sensing radius of at least one sensor. In this paper we argue that this is a conservative definition of coverage. This definition implicitly assumes that each sensor makes a decision independent of other sensors in the field. However, sensors can cooperate to make an accurate estimation, even if any single sensor is unable to do so. We then propose a new notion of information coverage and investigate its implications for sensor deployment. Numerical and simulation results show that significant savings in terms of sensor density for complete coverage can be achieved by using our definition of information coverage compared to that by using the existing definition."

Our results show that the disk coverage model requires 4 times more sensors for localization compared to detection applications.

Introduction: Because of limitations in achieving high power singlemode characteristics in single vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), coherently coupled laser arrays offer one option to increase singlemode output power. Previously, coherent arrays have been fabricated using mirror reflectivity modulation, or cavity or phase modifications to achieve coupling between adjacent elements in vertical structures [1–4]. We propose using two-dimensional photonic crystals to delineate a coherent VCSEL array, with individual defects (the absence of photonic crystal holes) creating the lasing elements. In this case, the lasing array is wholly contained within the same unpixelated gain area."

A single-chip low-IF TV tuner solution is proposed so that the image can be suppressed digitally using an image cancellation technique based on a complex one-tap LMS signal decorrelation algorithm. Programmable digital filtering and video/sound demodulation make a multistandard TV tuner feasible in the 48-860 MHz VHF/UHF band. The chip has a maximum gain of 63 dB and an input automatic gain control (AGC) range from -15 to 25 dB with 0.85-dB steps. It achieves an image and IF rejection of 60 dB, a peak …"

Such domain shifts, common in practical scenarios, severely damage the performance of conventional machine learning methods. Supervised domain adaptation methods have been proposed for the case when the target data have labels, including some that perform very well despite being``frustratingly easy''to implement. However, in practice, the target domain is often unlabeled, requiring unsupervised adaptation. We propose a simple, effective, and efficient method for unsupervised domain adaptation called CORrelation ALignment (CORAL).

Thus, large variance in instance scales, which results in undesirable large intracategory variance in features, may severely hurt the performance of modern object instance detection methods. We argue that this issue can be substantially alleviated by the divide-and-conquer philosophy. Taking pedestrian detection as an example, we illustrate how we can leverage this philosophy to develop a Scale-Aware Fast R-CNN (SAF R-CNN) framework. The model introduces multiple built-in subnetworks which detect pedestrians with scales from disjoint ranges. Outputs from all of the subnetworks are then adaptively combined to generate the final detection results that are shown to be robust to large variance in instance scales, via a gate …"

One of the major challenges lies in the lack of spatial and temporal cues, which makes it difficult to deal with large variations of lighting conditions, viewing angles, body poses, and occlusions. Recently, several deep-learning-based person re-identification approaches have been proposed and achieved remarkable performance. However, most of those approaches extract discriminative features from the whole frame at one glimpse without differentiating various parts of the persons to identify. It is essentially important to examine multiple highly discriminative local regions of the person images in details through multiple glimpses for dealing with the large appearance variance. In this paper, we propose a new soft attention-based model, i.e., the end-to-end comparative attention …"

Natural language object retrieval differs from text-based image retrieval task as it involves spatial information about objects within the scene and global scene context. To address this issue, we propose a novel Spatial Context Recurrent ConvNet (SCRC) model as scoring function on candidate boxes for object retrieval, integrating spatial configurations and global scene-level contextual information into the network. Our model processes query text, local image descriptors, spatial configurations and global context features through a recurrent network, outputs the probability of the query text conditioned on each candidate box as a score for the box, and can transfer visual-linguistic knowledge from image captioning domain to our task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes both local and global information, outperforming previous baseline methods significantly on different datasets and scenarios, and can exploit large scale vision and language datasets for knowledge transfer."

In this paper, we propose a simple to complex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized to learn DCNNs for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first train an initial segmentation network called Initial-DCNN with the saliency maps of simple images (i.e., those with a single category of major object(s) and clean background).

Classification networks are only responsive to small and sparse discriminative regions from the object of interest, which deviates from the requirement of the segmentation task that needs to localize dense, interior and integral regions for pixel-wise inference. To mitigate this gap, we propose a new adversarial erasing approach for localizing and expanding object regions progressively. Starting with a single small object region, our proposed approach drives the classification network to sequentially discover new and complement object regions by erasing the current mined regions in an adversarial manner. These localized regions eventually constitute a dense and complete object region for learning semantic segmentation. To further enhance the quality of the discovered regions by adversarial erasing, an online prohibitive segmentation learning approach is developed to collaborate with adversarial erasing by providing auxiliary segmentation supervision modulated by the more reliable classification scores. Despite its apparent simplicity, the proposed approach achieves 55.0% and 55.7% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores on PASCAL VOC 2012 val and test sets, which are the new state-of-the-arts."

Our core ideas lie in our new rain image model and new deep learning architecture. We add a binary map that provides rain streak locations to an existing model, which comprises a rain streak layer and a background layer. We create a model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method, a new contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual information and to produce better representations for rain detection. The evaluation on real images, particularly on heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our models and architecture."

Existing object detection pipelines usually detect small objects through learning representations of all the objects at multiple scales. However, the performance gain of such ad hoc architectures is usually limited to pay off the computational cost. In this work, we address the small object detection problem by developing a single architecture that internally lifts representations of small objects to super-resolved ones, achieving similar characteristics as large objects and thus more discriminative for detection. For this purpose, we propose a new Perceptual Generative Adversarial Network (Perceptual GAN) model that improves small object detection through narrowing representation difference of small objects from the large ones. Specifically, its generator learns to transfer perceived poor representations of the small objects to super-resolved ones that are similar enough to real large objects to fool a competing discriminator. Meanwhile its discriminator competes with the generator to identify the generated representation and imposes an additional perceptual requirement-generated representations of small objects must be beneficial for detection purpose-on the generator. Extensive evaluations on the challenging Tsinghua-Tencent 100K and the Caltech benchmark well demonstrate the superiority of Perceptual GAN in detecting small objects, including traffic signs and pedestrians, over well-established state-of-the-arts."

Our model is based on a new tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) and its induced tensor tubal rank and tensor nuclear norm. Consider that we have a 3-way tensor X in R^ n* n* n_3 such that X= L_0+ S_0, where L_0 has low tubal rank and S_0 is sparse. Is that possible to recover both components? In this work, we prove that under certain suitable assumptions, we can recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by simply solving a convex program whose objective is a weighted combination of the tensor nuclear norm and the l1-norm, ie, min L, E st|| L|| _*+ lambda|| E|| _1 st X= L+ E. where lambda= 1/sqrtmax (n_1, n_2) n_3. Interestingly, TRPCA involves RPCA as a special case when n_3= 1 and thus it is a simple and elegant tensor extension of RPCA.

This prevents them from efficiently processing big data. In this paper, we develop an Online Robust PCA (OR-PCA) that processes one sample per time instance and hence its memory cost is independent of the number of samples, significantly enhancing the computation and storage efficiency. The proposed OR-PCA is based on stochastic optimization of an equivalent reformulation of the batch RPCA. Indeed, we show that OR-PCA provides a sequence of subspace estimations converging to the optimum of its batch counterpart and hence is provably robust to sparse corruption. Moreover, OR-PCA can naturally be applied for tracking dynamic subspace. Comprehensive simulations on subspace recovering and tracking demonstrate the robustness and efficiency advantages of the OR-PCA over online PCA and batch RPCA methods."

We first mathematically prove that class localization maps can be obtained by directly selecting the class-specific feature maps of the last convolutional layer, which paves a simple way to identify object regions. We then present a simple network architecture including two parallel-classifiers for object localization. Specifically, we leverage one classification branch to dynamically localize some discriminative object regions during the forward pass. Although it is usually responsive to sparse parts of the target objects, this classifier can drive the counterpart classifier to discover new and complementary object regions by erasing its discovered regions from the feature maps. With such an adversarial learning, the two parallel-classifiers are forced to leverage complementary object regions for classification and can finally generate integral object localization together. The merits of ACoL are mainly two-fold: 1) it can be trained in an end-to-end manner; 2) dynamically erasing enables the counterpart classifier to discover complementary object regions more effectively. We demonstrate the superiority of our ACoL approach in a variety of experiments. In particular, the Top-1 localization error rate on the ILSVRC dataset is 45.14%, which is the new state-of-the-art."

We obverse that the performance gap mainly comes from the inability of producing dense and integral pixel-level object localization for training images only with image-level labels. In this work, we revisit the dilated convolution proposed in [1] and shed light on how it enables the classification network to generate dense object localization. By substantially enlarging the receptive fields of convolutional kernels with different dilation rates, the classification network can localize the object regions even when they are not so discriminative for classification and finally produce reliable object regions for benefiting both weakly-and semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Despite the apparent simplicity of dilated convolution, we are able to obtain superior performance for semantic segmentation tasks.

In this way, more reliable landmark points are refined earlier and help to infer locations of other challenging landmarks that may stay with occlusions and/or extreme poses. RAR can thus effectively control detection errors from those challenging landmarks and improve overall performance even in presence of heavy occlusions and/or extreme conditions.

The main advantages of these modulation strategies are the low switching frequencies of the devices, the good output voltage spectra, and the low electromagnetic interference. However, when these techniques are applied to the three-level neutral-point (NP)-clamped inverter, low-frequency oscillations appear in the NP voltage for some operating conditions. As a result, the value of the dc-link capacitors must be increased in order to attenuate such oscillations. In this paper, these amplitudes are quantified for two modulation strategies that use nearest vectors to the reference vector. Owing to the nondimensional variables used in the analysis, the information provided will help for the calculation of the dc-link capacitors in a given specific application. Simulated and experimental examples are presented."

In this paper, we propose a new class of LSTM network, global context-aware attention LSTM, for skeleton-based action recognition, which is capable of selectively focusing on the informative joints in each frame by using a global context memory cell. To further improve the attention capability, we also introduce a recurrent attention mechanism, with which the attention …"

Generally, blur causes spread of edges, which leads to shape changes in images. Discrete orthogonal moments have been widely studied as effective shape descriptors. Intuitively, blur can be represented using discrete moments since noticeable blur affects the magnitudes of moments of an image. With this consideration, this paper presents a blind image blur evaluation algorithm based on discrete Tchebichef moments. The gradient of a blurred image is first computed to account for the shape, which is more effective for blur representation. Then the gradient image is divided into equal-size blocks and the Tchebichef moments are calculated to characterize image shape. The energy of a block is computed as the sum of squared non-DC moment values. Finally, the proposed image blur score is defined as the variance-normalized moment energy, which is …"

We present a novel framework based on adversarial autoencoders to learn a generalized latent feature representation across domains for domain generalization. To be specific, we extend adversarial autoencoders by imposing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to align the distributions among different domains, and matching the aligned distribution to an arbitrary prior distribution via adversarial feature learning. In this way, the learned feature representation is supposed to be universal to the seen source domains because of the MMD regularization, and is expected to generalize well on the target domain because of the introduction of the prior distribution. We proposed an algorithm to jointly train different components of our proposed framework. Extensive experiments on various vision tasks demonstrate that our proposed framework can learn better generalized features for the unseen target domain compared with state of-the-art domain generalization methods."

The MLV distribution of the pixels is an indicative of sharpness. We use standard deviation of the MLV distribution as a feature to measure sharpness. Since high variations in the pixel intensities is a better indicator of the sharpness than low variations, the MLV of the pixels are subjected to a weighting scheme in such a way that heavier weights are assigned to greater MLVs to make the tail end of MLV distribution thicker. The weighting leads to an improvement of the MLV distribution to be more discriminative for different blur degrees. Finally, the standard deviation of the weighted MLV distribution is used as a metric to measure sharpness. The proposed …"

The velocity and attitude subsystems are transformed into the linearly parameterized form. Based on the parameter projection estimation, the dynamic inverse control is proposed via the back‐stepping scheme. In order to avoid the problem of “explosion of complexity,” by introducing a first‐order filtering of the synthetic input at each step, the dynamic surface control is designed.

Four configurations of mobile robots are considered, and perturbations due to skidding and slipping are categorically classified as input-additive, input multiplicative, and/or matched/unmatched perturbations. Furthermore, we relate the WMR's maneuverability with the vehicle controllability that provides a measure on the WMR ability to track a trajectory in the presence of wheel skidding and slipping.

It is also the same effect that suppresses the soliton pulse collapse, an intrinsic feature of solitons propagating in gain media, and makes the solitons stable in the laser. Furthermore, we show that the soliton energy quantization observed in the lasers is a natural consequence of the gain competition between the multiple solitons. Enlightened by the numerical result we speculate that multisoliton formation and soliton energy quantization observed in other types of soliton fiber lasers could have a similar mechanism."

It is also found that random doping with boron or nitrogen is possible to open a small gap in the Dirac points, except for the modulation of the Fermi level. The surface charges which belong to the π states near Dirac points are found to be redistributed locally. The charge redistribution is attributed to the change of localized potential due to doping effects. The band opening induced by the doped BN domain is found to be due to the breaking of localized symmetry of the potential. Therefore, doping graphene with BN domains is an effective method to open a band gap for carbon-based next-generation microelectronic devices."

A distributed finite-time control approach is used in the voltage restoration which enables the voltages at all the distributed generations (DGs) to converge to the reference value in finite time, and thus, the voltage and frequency control design can be separated. Then, a consensus-based distributed frequency control is proposed for frequency restoration, subject to certain control input constraints. Our control strategies are implemented on the local DGs, and thus, no central controller is required in contrast to existing control schemes proposed so far.

A CFD model is firstly established and calibrated by actual experimental data, and then used to create 95 different ejector geometries and tested under different working conditions. From 210 testing results, it is found that the optimum NXP is not only proportional to the mixing section throat diameter, but also increases as the primary flow pressure rises. On the other hand, the ejector performance is very sensitive to θ especially near the optimum working point. The entrainment ratio can vary as much as 26.6% by changing θ. A relatively bigger θ is required to better maximize the ejector performance when the primary flow pressure rises. The significance of the …"

The nonlinearities of the system are not required to be globally Lipschitz. Since the system contains unknown parameters, it is a difficult task to check the assumption of the input-to-state stability (ISS) with respect to the measurement errors, which is required in most existing literature. To solve this problem, we design both the adaptive controller and the triggering event at the same time such that the ISS assumption is no longer needed. In addition to presenting new design methodologies based on the fixed threshold strategy and relative threshold strategy, we also propose a new strategy named the switching threshold strategy.

In this paper, this assumption is removed by using an initial state learning scheme together with the traditional D-type ILC updating law. Both linear and nonlinear time-varying uncertain systems are investigated. Uniform bounds for the final tracking errors are obtained and these bounds are only dependent on the system uncertainties and disturbances, yet independent of the initial errors.

Outdoor localization can be solved by the GPS technique, but how to accurately and efficiently localize pedestrians in indoor environments is still a challenging problem. Recent techniques based on WiFi or pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) have several limiting problems, such as the variation of WiFi signals and the drift of PDR. An auxiliary tool for indoor localization is landmarks, which can be easily identified based on specific sensor patterns in the environment, and this will be exploited in our proposed approach. In this work, we propose a sensor fusion framework for combining WiFi, PDR and landmarks. Since the whole system is running on a smartphone, which is resource limited, we formulate the sensor fusion problem in a linear perspective, then a Kalman filter is applied instead of a particle filter, which is widely used in the literature. Furthermore, novel techniques to enhance the accuracy of individual approaches are adopted. In the experiments, an Android app is developed for real-time indoor localization and navigation.

Augmenting them to identify the touch interactions with multiple smart-phones can enable interesting co-located communal applications with context-based personalized interactions and information exchange amongst users' portable devices and the shared wall display. This paper proposes a novel matching technique, called tilt correlation, which employs the built-in tilt sensor to identify smart-phones that make concurrent two-point contacts on a common multi-touch wall display. Experimental investigations suggest that the resultant error rate is relatively low; in addition, we also propose a quantitative measure, called the Bourne Identity Index to allow application designers to determine the reliability of each device identification."

The blotches in noise-corrupted image sequences exhibit a temporal discontinuity characteristic which is commonly used for the detection of blotches. However, the badly motion compensated pixels will also appear as temporal discontinuities, thus making it difficult to distinguish the true blotches from the poorly motion compensated regions. The proposed MRF model addresses the problem of incorrect detection. It is found that the degree of false-alarm in the detection of the blotches in image sequences can be reduced by using a moving-edge detector in the MRF model to identify the blotch-edges from the moving edges."

We first solved this problem by extending the traditional A* algorithm into 3D, namely two spatial and one time dimensions. This 3D approach is proved computationally costly and this led to the development of a novel and faster Spatio-Temporal (S-T) A* algorithm. This is a modified A* algorithm, which uses discrete time stamps and a temporal occupancy table to communicate previously planned routes and potential collision among robots. We further adapted the S-T A* algorithm to allow robots to stop and wait near nodes where potential collision is detected in order to increase their probability of finding a viable path to their destination. Using a time-based objective function that requires all robots in the environment to reach their respective destination …"

This work proposes a novel concept of structural and textural skeletons. The former is associated with the general shape structure and the latter with boundary perturbations. These skeletons remain disconnected to facilitate gross shape matching without the need for branch pruning. They are extracted from a multiresolution gradient vector field that is efficiently generated within a pyramidal framework. Experimental results show that these skeletons are scale and rotation invariant. They are less affected by boundary noise compared to skeletons extracted by popular iterative and non-iterative techniques.

This paper demonstrates that such Moiré pattern can useful in measuring surface deformation and displacement. What is required, in our case, is that the surface in question is textured with appropriately aligned black and white line gratings and this surface is imaged using a grey scaled CCD camera. The characteristics of the observed Moiré patterns are described along with a spatial domain model-fitting algorithm that is able to extract a dense camera-to-surface displacement measures. The experimental results discuss the reconstruction of planar incline and curved surfaces using only a coarse 33 lines per inch line grating patterns printed from a 600 dpi printer. 1"

To meet this requirement, a new multiresolution region-growing algorithm is proposed. This algorithm consists of a region-growing process which is able to segment the flow field in an image into homogeneous regions which are consistent with a linear affine flow model. To ensure stability and robustness in the presence of noise, this region-growing process is implemented within the hierarchical framework of a spatial lowpass pyramid. The results of applying this algorithm to both natural and synthetic image sequences are presented."

Artificial data generation is a potential solution to address these issues. Among generative techniques, the method of generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the successful applications in image processing has gained a lot of attention. The application of GANs for time-series data generation is a recent growing topic that first of all its feasibility needs to be assessed. In the present study, we investigate the performance of GANs in generating artificial electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The results suggest that the generated EEG signals by GANs resemble the temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics of real EEG. It thus opens new perspectives for further research in this area."

This paper presents DualGaze, a novel interaction method in which users perform a distinctive two-step gaze gesture for object selection. Once users gaze upon an object that they wish to select, a confirmation flag pops up next to the object at a location where the users' gaze just passed through. This trajectory-adaptive flag placement strategy reduces the chance of unintentional confirmation by requiring a returning gaze back to the flag. We conducted a user study to compare the accuracy and selection speed of DualGaze and the popular gaze fixation method on a simple gaze-typing task. Our results …"

However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the Kinect sensor's low image resolution. A comprehensive repertoire of 3D …"

This paper describes some useful strategies that can be employed to improve the performance of such shape matching algorithms. Firstly, it is important that ligature-sensitive information be incorporated into the part decomposition and shape matching processes. Secondly, part decomposition should be treated as a dynamic process in which the selection of the final decomposition of a shape is deferred until the shape matching stage. Thirdly, both local and global measures must be employed when computing shape dissimilarity. Finally, skeletal segments must be weighted by appropriate visual saliency measures during the part matching process. These saliency measures include curvature and ligature-based measures. Experimental results show that the incorporation of these strategies significantly improves shape …"

However, this assumption is unrealistic in natural images, where edges have varying degrees of blur. This paper generalizes the edge model to one containing a local blurring factor, and gives finite closed-form solutions for edge location with sub-pixel accuracy. Solutions are based on the spatial moments up to the second-order, and are theoretically precise within the finite size of a windowed area. Moreover, the integral nature of low order spatial moments provide the algorithm some resilience against additive white noise. Experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the accuracy of the proposed method is comparable to the more computationally demanding nonlinear optimization method. Absolute error of less than 0.02 pixel is demonstrated on one image of a grid pattern."

Despite the effective application of deep learning (DL) in brain–computer interface (BCI) systems, the successful execution of this technique, especially for inter-subject classification, in cognitive BCI has not been accomplished yet. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the attentive mental state from single-channel raw electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Approach.
We develop an end-to-end deep CNN to decode the attentional information from an EEG time series. We also explore the consequences of input representations on the performance of deep CNN by feeding three different EEG representations into the network. To ensure the practical application of the proposed framework and avoid time-consuming re-training, we perform inter-subject transfer learning techniques as a classification strategy.

Augmenting them to identify the touch interactions with multiple smart-phones can enable interesting co-located communal applications with context-based personalized interactions and information exchange amongst users' portable devices and the shared wall display. This paper proposes a novel matching technique, called tilt correlation, which employs the built-in tilt sensor to identify smart-phones that make concurrent two-point contacts on a common multi-touch wall display. Experimental investigations suggest that the resultant error rate is relatively low; in addition, we also propose a quantitative measure, called the Bourne Identity Index to allow application designers to determine the reliability of each device identification."

The blotches in noise-corrupted image sequences exhibit a temporal discontinuity characteristic which is commonly used for the detection of blotches. However, the badly motion compensated pixels will also appear as temporal discontinuities, thus making it difficult to distinguish the true blotches from the poorly motion compensated regions. The proposed MRF model addresses the problem of incorrect detection. It is found that the degree of false-alarm in the detection of the blotches in image sequences can be reduced by using a moving-edge detector in the MRF model to identify the blotch-edges from the moving edges."

This work proposes a novel concept of structural and textural skeletons. The former is associated with the general shape structure and the latter with boundary perturbations. These skeletons remain disconnected to facilitate gross shape matching without the need for branch pruning. They are extracted from a multiresolution gradient vector field that is efficiently generated within a pyramidal framework. Experimental results show that these skeletons are scale and rotation invariant. They are less affected by boundary noise compared to skeletons extracted by popular iterative and non-iterative techniques.

This algorithm consists of a region-growing process which is able to segment the flow field in an image into homogeneous regions which are consistent with a linear affine flow model. To ensure stability and robustness in the presence of noise, this region-growing process is implemented within the hierarchical framework of a spatial lowpass pyramid.

Once users gaze upon an object that they wish to select, a confirmation flag pops up next to the object at a location where the users' gaze just passed through. This trajectory-adaptive flag placement strategy reduces the chance of unintentional confirmation by requiring a returning gaze back to the flag. We conducted a user study to compare the accuracy and selection speed of DualGaze and the popular gaze fixation method on a simple gaze-typing task. Our results …"

File distribution systems often have to cope with extreme conditions, called flash crowds, when the number of users suddenly surges. Flash crowds affect the efficiency of the file distribution and impact user download performance. Thus, content distributors have to ensure that the system has sufficient capacity to cope with flash crowds while maintaining the agreed quality of service with minimum costs. To cope with flash crowds, protocol designers need to understand how p2p protocols match both users and content distributors expectations. The objective of this thesis is to develop methods for understanding and predicting the performance of file distribution systems during flash crowds. Contrary to current assumption that peer bandwidth utilization is constant throughout the download process, our measurement study on PlanetLab shows three distinct phases in the utilization of peer bandwidth over the download time, namely start-up, maximum utilization, and end-game. Furthermore, a key observation is that the last phase has a step-like function that corresponds with the number of classes of peers with different upload bandwidth. Based on these measurement observations, we propose a general analytical approach to predict the download performance of a file under flash crowd conditions and demonstrate the robustness of our approach for a number of applications."

Hence, we build on top of a state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm SVD++ which inherently involves the explicit and implicit influence of rated items, by further incorporating both the explicit and implicit influence of trusted users on the prediction of items for an active user.

The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding, product positioning, and corporate reputation management.

Namely, the classifier is implemented as a specially designed deep convolutional neural network, with injection of the document-level Mairesse features, extracted directly from the text, into an inner layer. The first layers of the network treat each sentence of the text separately; then the sentences are aggregated into the document vector. Filtering out emotionally neutral input sentences improved the performance.

This allows humans to adapt easily to novel situations where AI fails catastrophically due to a lack of situation-specific rules and generalization capabilities. Commonsense knowledge also provides background information that enables humans to successfully operate in social situations where such knowledge is typically assumed. Since commonsense consists of information that humans take for granted, gathering it is an extremely difficult task.

Since a fixed threshold cannot adequately handle the dynamic relationships between moving entities, a multi-level threshold scheme is proposed.

Attacks using a server could be DoS attack, Phishing attack, E-mail spamming and so on. Sometimes an attacker breaks into a public SSH server and uses it for the above activities. Mostly, it is hard to detect the compromised SSH servers that were used by the attackers. However, by analysing the system logs an organisation can know about the compromises. For an organisation holding several SSH servers, it would be tedious to analyse the log files manually. Also, high-speed networks demand better mechanisms to detect the compromises. In this paper, we detect a compromised SSH session that is carrying out malicious activities. We use flow-based approach and machine learning techniques to detect a compromised session. In a flow-based approach, individual packets are not scrutinised. Hence, it works better on a high-speed network. The data is extracted from a distributed honeypot. The paper also describes the machine learning techniques with appropriate parameters and feature selection technique. A real-time detection model that is tested on a public server is also presented.

The PGTP, presented in this paper is aware of both the transport requirement of these multiplayer mobile games and the limitation posed by battery resource. PGTP dynamically controls the transport based on the criticality of game state and the network state to save energy at the wireless network interface (WNIC) level with almost no degradation to the quality of the game play."

Fast and scalable simulations are therefore needed to allow for sufficient exploration of large multi-core systems within a limited simulation time budget. By bringing together accurate high-abstraction analytical models with fast parallel simulation, architects can trade off accuracy with simulation speed to allow for longer application runs, covering a larger portion of the hardware design space.

This multi-core simulator is based on the interval core model and the Graphite simulation infrastructure, allowing for fast and accurate simulation and for trading off simulation speed for accuracy to allow a range of flexible simulation options when exploring different homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-core architectures. The Sniper simulator allows one to perform timing simulations for both multi-programmed workloads and multi-threaded, shared-memory applications running on 10s to 100+ cores, at a high speed when compared to existing simulators. The main feature of the simulator is its core model which is based on interval simulation, a fast mechanistic core model. Interval simulation raises the level of abstraction in architectural simulation which allows for faster simulator development and evaluation times; it does so by ’jumping’ between miss events, called intervals. Sniper has been validated against multi-socket Intel Core2 and Nehalem systems and provides average performance prediction errors within 25% at a simulation speed of up to several MIPS. This simulator, and the interval core model, is useful for uncore and system-level studies that require more detail than the typical one-IPC models, but for which cycle-accurate simulators are too slow to allow workloads of meaningful sizes to be simulated. As an added benefit, the interval core model allows the generation of CPI stacks, which show the number of cycles lost due to different characteristics of the system, like the cache hierarchy or branch predictor, and lead to a better understanding of each …"

We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to squash and re-execute speculatively reordered loads in TSO when their reordering is seen. Instead, the reordering can be hidden form other cores by the coherence protocol. The implication is that we can irrevocably bind speculative loads.

However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the Kinect sensor's low image resolution.

This paper describes some useful strategies that can be employed to improve the performance of such shape matching algorithms. Firstly, it is important that ligature-sensitive information be incorporated into the part decomposition and shape matching processes. Secondly, part decomposition should be treated as a dynamic process in which the selection of the final decomposition of a shape is deferred until the shape matching stage. Thirdly, both local and global measures must be employed when computing shape dissimilarity. Finally, skeletal segments must be weighted by appropriate visual saliency measures during the part matching process. These saliency measures include curvature and ligature-based measures. Experimental results show that the incorporation of these strategies significantly improves shape …"

However, this assumption is unrealistic in natural images, where edges have varying degrees of blur. This paper generalizes the edge model to one containing a local blurring factor, and gives finite closed-form solutions for edge location with sub-pixel accuracy. Solutions are based on the spatial moments up to the second-order, and are theoretically precise within the finite size of a windowed area. Moreover, the integral nature of low order spatial moments provide the algorithm some resilience against additive white noise. Experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the accuracy of the proposed method is comparable to the more computationally demanding nonlinear optimization method. Absolute error of less than 0.02 pixel is demonstrated on one image of a grid pattern."

Experimental results show that these skeletons are scale and rotation invariant. They are less affected by boundary noise compared to skeletons extracted by popular iterative and non-iterative techniques.

Since it is often infeasible to elicit the preferences of all the voters in a typical prediction scenario, a common algorithm used for winner prediction is to run the election on a small sample of randomly chosen votes and output the winner as the prediction. We analyze the performance of this algorithm for many common voting rules. More formally, we introduce the (ε, δ)-winner determination problem, where given an election on n voters and m candidates in which the margin of victory is at least εn votes, the goal is to determine the winner with probability at least 1− δ. The margin of victory of an election is the smallest number of votes that need to be modified in order to change the election winner.

∑ k j= 1 vjxij= z, where z may either be an input or a fixed vector. We also study a variant of this, where instead of finding xi1,..., xik∈ S for which
∑ k j= 1 vjxij= z, we require that z be in span (xi1,..., xik), which we call the (k, r)-LinDependenceq problem. These problems are natural generalizations of well-studied problems that occur in coding theory and property testing. Indeed, the (k, r)-LinDependenceq problem is just the Maximum Likelihood Decoding problem for linear codes. Also, in the TargetSum problem, if instead of general z we require z= 0n, then this is the Weight Distribution problem for linear codes. In property testing, these problems have been implicitly studied in the context of testing linear-invariant properties. We give nearly optimal bounds for TargetSum and (k, r)-LinDependenceq for every r, k, and constant q. Namely, assuming 3-SAT requires exponential time, we show that any algorithm for these problems must run in min (2Θ (n), rΘ (k)) time. Moreover, we give deterministic upper bounds that match this complexity, up to constant factors in the exponent. Our lower bound strengthens and simplifies an earlier min (2Θ (n), rΩ (k1/4)) lower bound for both the Maximum Likelihood Decoding and Weight Distribution problems.

In this framework, the probability density of the tracker state is represented as a set of modes with piecewise Gaussians characterizing the neighborhood around these modes. The temporal evolution of the probability density is achieved through sampling from the prior distribution, followed by local optimization of the sample positions to obtain updated modes. This method of generating hypotheses from state-space search does not require the use of discrete features unlike classical multiple-hypothesis tracking. The parametric form of the model is suited for high dimensional state-spaces which cannot be efficiently modeled using non-parametric approaches.

However, this technique alone does not eliminate shadows: multiple projectors create multiple dark regions on the surface (penumbral occlusions). We solve the problem by using cameras to automatically identify occlusions as they occur and dynamically adjust each projector's output so that additional light is projected onto each partially-occluded patch.

In this paper, we present an approach for pluralistic image completion-the task of generating multiple and diverse plausible solutions for image completion. A major challenge faced by learning-based approaches is that usually only one ground truth training instance per label. As such, sampling from conditional VAEs still leads to minimal diversity. To overcome this, we propose a novel and probabilistically principled framework with two parallel paths. One is a reconstructive path that utilizes the only one given ground truth to get prior distribution of missing parts and rebuild the original image from this distribution. The other is a generative path for which the conditional prior is coupled to the distribution obtained in the reconstructive path. Both are supported by GANs. We also introduce a new short+ long term attention layer that exploits distant relations among decoder and encoder features, improving appearance consistency. When tested on datasets with buildings (Paris), faces (CelebA-HQ), and natural images (ImageNet), our method not only generated higherquality completion results, but also with multiple and diverse plausible outputs."

We first construct deep CNN layers for color and depth separately, and then connect them with our carefully designed multi-modal layers, which fuse color and depth information by enforcing a common part to be shared by features of different modalities. In this way, we obtain features reflecting shared properties as well as modal-specific properties in different modalities.

This is done via a reconstruction loss when the training input is real, and a GAN loss when synthetic, removing the need for heuristic self-regularization. The second network is trained on a task loss for synthetic image-depth pairs, with an extra GAN loss to unify real and synthetic feature distributions.

A point is a skyline point if there does not exists any point that can dominate it. Skyline queries, which return skyline points, are useful in many decision making applications. Unfortunately, as the number of dimensions increases, the chance of one point dominating another point is very low. As such, the number of skyline points become too numerous to offer any interesting insights. To find more important and meaningful skyline points in high dimensional space, we propose a new concept, called k-dominant skyline which relaxes the idea of dominance to k-dominance.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to process a twig query based on region encoding labeling scheme. While region encoding supports efficient determination of ancestor-descendant (or parent-child) relationship between two elements, we observe that the information within a single label is very limited. In this paper, we propose a new labeling scheme, called extended Dewey. This is a powerful labeling scheme, since from the label of an element alone, we can derive all the elements names along the path from the root to the element. Based on extended Dewey, we design a novel holistic twig join algorithm, called TJFast. Unlike all previous algorithms based on region encoding, to answer a twig query, TJFast only needs to access the labels of the leaf query nodes. Through this, not only do we reduce disk access, but we also support the efficient evaluation of queries with wildcards in branching nodes, which is very difficult to be answered by algorithms based on region encoding. Finally, we report our experimental results to show that our algorithms are superior to previous approaches in terms of the number of elements scanned, the size of intermediate results and query performance."

Security views effectively protect sensitive data from access and potential inferences by unauthorized user, and provide authorized users with necessary schema information to facilitate effective query formulation and optimization.

In a high-dimensional space skyline points no longer offer any interesting insights as there are too many of them. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, called skyline frequency that compares and ranks the interestingness of data points based on how often they are returned in the skyline when different number of dimensions (i.e., subspaces) are considered. Intuitively, a point with a high skyline frequency is more interesting as it can be dominated on fewer combinations of the dimensions. Thus, the problem becomes one of finding top-k frequent skyline points. But the algorithms thus far proposed for skyline computation typically do not scale well with dimensionality. Moreover, frequent skyline computation requires that skylines be …"

XML (Extensible Markup Language) has become the dominant standard for data encoding and exchange on the Internet, including e-business transactions in both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) applications. Given the rapid growth of XML traffic on the Internet, the effective and efficient delivery of XML documents has become an important issue. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the area of XML content-based filtering and routing, which addresses the problem of effectively directing high volumes of XML-document traffic to interested consumers based on document contents. Effective support for scalable, content-based XML routing is crucial to enable efficient and timely delivery of relevant XML documents to a large, dynamic group of consumers."

We analyze the CkNN based solution and point out that when k > 1 the refinement cost becomes the system bottleneck. We propose a new continuous refinement method called CRange-k. In CRange- k, we transform the continuous verification problem into a Continuous Range-k query, which is also defined in this paper, and process it efficiently. Experimental study shows that the CRkNN solution based on our CRange-k refinement method is more efficient and scalable than the state-of-the- art CRkNN solution."

To kick-start the construction of a target query Q, the user first provides a pair of inputs: a sample database D and an output table R which is the result of Q on D. As there will be many candidate queries that transform D to R, QFE winnows this collection by presenting the user with new database-result pairs that distinguish these candidates.

Mobile nodes in MobTorrent use the WWAN network as a control channel.

First, we investigate how residual link lifetime is affected by parameters such as speed and mobility pattern using simulation. The result shows that residual link lifetime is a function of current link age, mobility speed and mobility pattern and does not vary monotonically with age. Therefore, intuitive idea such as older links are more stable, which is used in existing stability-based routing algorithms like associativity based routing (ABR), does not hold across a large spectrum of mobility speeds and models. Instead, the …"

Recently, there has been significant interest in the use of statistical-based filtering to defend against and mitigate the effect of DDoS attacks. Under this approach, packet statistics are monitored to classify normal and abnormal behaviour. Under attack, packets that are classified as abnormal are dropped by the filter that guards the victim network. We study the effectiveness of DDoS attacks on such statistical-based filtering in a general context where the attackers are ""smart"". We first give an optimal policy for the filter when the statistical behaviours of both the attackers and the filter are static. We next consider cases where both the attacker and the filter can dynamically change their behaviour, possibly depending on the perceived behaviour of the other party. We observe …"

We define more strict requirements on the anonymity and security properties of the routing protocol, and notice that previous research works only provide weak location privacy and route anonymity, and are vulnerable to specific attacks. Therefore, we propose the anonymous secure routing (ASR) protocol that can provide additional properties on anonymity, i.e. identity anonymity and strong location privacy, and at the same time ensure the security of discovered routes against various passive and active attacks. Detailed analysis shows that ASR can achieve both anonymity and security properties, as defined in the requirements, of the routing protocol in mobile ad-hoc networks."

Abstract A large body of previous models to predict where people look in natural scenes focused on pixel-level image attributes. To bridge the semantic gap between the predictive power of computational saliency models and human behavior, we propose a new saliency architecture that incorporates information at three layers: pixel-level image attributes, object-level attributes, and semantic-level attributes. Object-and semantic-level information is frequently ignored, or only a few sample object categories are discussed where scaling to a large number of object categories is not feasible nor neurally plausible. To address this problem, this work constructs a principled vocabulary of basic attributes to describe object-and semantic-level information thus not restricting to a limited number of object categories. We build a new dataset of 700 images with eye-tracking data of 15 viewers and annotation data of 5,551 segmented objects with fine contours and 12 semantic attributes (publicly available with the paper). Experimental results demonstrate the importance of the object-and semantic-level information in the prediction of visual attention."

Audio keyword is a middle-level representation that can bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level semantics. Audio keywords are created from low-level audio features by using support vector machine learning. The created audio keywords can be used to detect semantic events in soccer video by applying a heuristic mapping. Experiments of audio keywords creation and event detection based on audio keywords have illustrated promising results. According to the experimental results, we believe that audio keyword is an effective representation that is able to achieve more intuitionistic result for event detection in sports video compared with the method of event detection directly based on low-level features."

There is a trend to move from conventional libraries to digital libraries. In digital libraries images and text are made available through the Internet for scholarly research. At the same time care is taken to prevent the unauthorized use of the images commercially. In some cases the observer is encouraged to patronize the institution that owns the material. To satisfy both these needs simultaneously the owner needs to use visible watermarking. Visible watermarking is a type of digital watermarking used for protection of publicly available images. We describe a visible watermarking scheme that is applied into the host image in the DCT domain. A mathematical model has been developed for this purpose. We also propose a modification of the algorithm to make the watermark more robust.

Sri Lanka has witnessed a series of dengue epidemics over the past five years, with the western province, home to the political capital of Colombo, bearing more than half of the dengue burden. Existing dengue monitoring prevention programs are exhausted as public health inspectors (PHIs) cope with increasing workloads and paper-based modes of surveillance and education, characterizing a reactive system unable to cope with the enormity of the problem. On the other hand, the unprecedented proliferation and affordability of mobile phones since 2009 and a supportive political climate have thus far remained unexploited for the use of mobile-based interventions for dengue management.
Objective
To conduct a needs assessment of PHIs in Colombo with respect to their dengue-related tasks and develop a new mobile-based system to address these needs while strengthening existing systems.
Methods
One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 PHIs to a) gain a nuanced, in-depth understanding of the current state of surveillance practices, b) understand the logistical, technological and social challenges they confront, and c) identify opportunities for mobile-based interventions. Quantitative analysis included simple descriptive statistics while qualitative analysis comprised textual analysis of 209 pages of transcripts (or nearly 600 minutes of conversations) using grounded theory approaches.
Results
Current paper-based data collection practices for dengue surveillance involved a circuitous, time consuming process that could take between 7-10 days to …"

The likelihood scores provided by the HMMs are compared, and the highest score provides the identity of the test video sequence. Furthermore, with unsupervised learning, each HMM is adapted with the test video sequence, which results in better modeling over time. Based on extensive experiments with various databases, we show that the proposed algorithm results in better …"

The spatial information is usually re-introduced as a post-processing step to re-rank the retrieved images, through a spatial verification like RANSAC. Since the spatial verification techniques are computationally expensive, they can be applied only to the top images in the initial ranking. In this paper, we propose an approach that can encode more spatial information into BoV representation and that is efficient enough to be applied to large-scale databases. Other works pursuing the same purpose have proposed exploring the word co-occurrences in the neighborhood areas.

The structure of this group provides meaningful context for reasoning about individuals in the group, and about the structure of the scene as a whole.

This “social context” allows us to accomplish a variety of tasks, such as such as demographic recognition, calculating scene and camera parameters, and even event recognition.

To detect falls, we use a combination of a body- worn triaxial accelerometer with motion detectors placed in the monitored area. While accelerometer provides information about the body motion during a fall, motion detectors monitor general presence or absence of motion. From all sensors, the data is transmitted wirelessly using the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol to a central node for processing. We use an implementation of carrier sense multiple access - collision avoidance scheme for channel reuse. A simple forwarding scheme is used to provide an extended coverage for a home environment. Fall detection is accomplished by a two-stage algorithm that utilizes the triaxial acceleration and the motion data sequentially. In the first stage, the …"

We propose a new architecture for secure applications, Cloud Terminal, in which the only software running on the end host is a lightweight secure thin terminal, and most application logic is in a remote cloud rendering engine. The secure thin terminal has a very small TCB (23 KLOC) and no dependence on the untrusted OS, so it can be easily checked and remotely attested to. The terminal is also general-purpose: it simply supplies a secure display and input path to remote software. The cloud rendering engine runs an off-the-shelf application in a restricted VM hosted by the provider, but resource sharing between VMs lets one server support hundreds of users. We implement a secure thin terminal that runs on standard PC hardware and provides a responsive interface to applications like banking, email, and document editing. We also show that our cloud rendering engine can provide secure online banking for 5–10 cents per user per month."

This is possible by utilizing on-board sensors (with same sensing modalities) to capture a common physical context (e.g., ambient sound via each device's microphone). However, in a smart home scenario, it is impractical to assume that all devices will share a common sensing modality. For example, a motion detector is only equipped with an infrared sensor while Amazon Echo only has microphones. In this paper, we develop a new context-based pairing mechanism called Perceptio that uses time as the common factor across differing sensor types. By focusing on the event timing, rather than the specific event sensor data, Perceptio creates event fingerprints that can be matched across a variety of IoT devices.

In this design, the on-chip antenna minimizes the packaging loss, while energy detection at RF allows architecture simplification. Both techniques contribute to the receiver's low power consumption of 51 mW, excluding test buffers. This leads to a bit energy efficiency of 28 pj/bit at 1.8 Gbps. The total die area is 3.8 mm 2 with the on-chip antenna occupying almost half of it."

The CdS NPs are polycrystalline and are composed of ultrasmall closely packed nanocrystallites. These crystallites increase in size as the duration of the CdS evaporation process increases. When the thickness of the NPs changes from about 10 to 50 nm, the size of the crystallites increases from about 5–14 to 20–40 nm. Photoluminescence measurements on the CdS NP arrays show a strong emission spectrum with two subbands that are attributed to band-edge and surface-defect emissions. The peak position and width of the band-edge emission band are closely related to the size of the crystallites in the CdS NPs."

Rapid vacancy diffusion plays a significant role at low temperatures in forming heterostructures of nickel oxide (NiO) nanotubes with Ni nanowires. Subsequent investigations of Ni nanowire oxidation at higher temperatures and faster temperature ramp rates show that it is difficult to bypass this rapid vacancy diffusion stage, which affects the formation of the final structure. Therefore, it is unlikely to form solid NiO nanowires or NiO nanotubes with uniform wall thickness through the conventional annealing/oxidation process of Ni nanowires. Instead, a step‐wise oxidation process by combining low temperature oxidation with a chemical etching step is utilized to produce for the first time NiO nanotubes with uniform wall thickness from Ni nanowires."

On the contrary, they can be very well combined within a single system as they are both based on a suitable 3-D scene representation. In other words, given a 3-D representation of a scene, if a stereo pair of images corresponding to the human eyes can be rendered, the functionality of 3DTV is provided. If a virtual view (ie, not an actual camera view) corresponding to an arbitrary viewpoint and viewing direction can be rendered, the functionality of FTV is provided. As seen in the movie The Matrix, successive switching of multiple real images captured at different angles can give the sensation of a flying viewpoint. In a similar way, Eye Vision [11] realized a flying virtual camera for a scene in a Super Bowl game. It used 33 cameras arranged around the stadium and controlled the camera directions mechanically to track the target scene. In these systems, however, no new virtual images are generated, and the movement of the viewpoint is limited to the predefined original camera positions; hence functionalities of 3DTV/FTV are not provided. It is in fact extremely challenging to realize these functionalities using a small number of sparsely positioned cameras in a large 3-D space such as a stadium.

The SO-Net models the spatial distribution of point cloud by building a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Based on the SOM, SO-Net performs hierarchical feature extraction on individual points and SOM nodes, and ultimately represents the input point cloud by a single feature vector. The receptive field of the network can be systematically adjusted by conducting point-to-node k nearest neighbor search. In recognition tasks such as point cloud reconstruction, classification, object part segmentation and shape retrieval, our proposed network demonstrates performance that is similar with or better than state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the training speed is significantly faster than existing point cloud recognition networks because of the parallelizability and simplicity of the proposed architecture. Our code is available at the project website."

The interior and exterior regions of the enclosure are analyzed separately by employing the field equivalence principle. Internal electromagnetic fields are discretized using the (FD) method, while external fields are formulated by the MoM. Enforcement of continuity of the tangential magnetic field over the aperture surface gives the desired equation to solve for electromagnetic fields everywhere. Numerical results for the shielding effectiveness of a rectangular cavity with apertures calculated by the new hybrid technique are presented and validated by comparing with experimental data."

With only a 2.2 μm thick Si absorber thin film, the short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of SiNWs/PEDOT cell increase from 12.5 to 13.6 mA/cm2 and from 5.4% to 5.6%, respectively, as compared to planar Si/PEDOT cell. A maximum external quantum efficiency of 56.6% is obtained for the SiNWs/PEDOT cell.

Different from existing metric learning-based face verification methods which aim to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric to maximize the inter-class variations and minimize the intra-class variations, simultaneously, the proposed DDML trains a deep neural network which learns a set of hierarchical nonlinear transformations to project face pairs into the same feature subspace, under which the distance of each positive face pair is less than a smaller threshold and that of each negative pair is higher than a larger threshold, respectively, so that discriminative information can be exploited in the deep network.

To render a full-color image, an interpolation process, commonly referred to as CFA demosaicking, is required to estimate the other two missing color values at each pixel. In this paper, we present two contributions to the CFA demosaicking: a new and improved CFA demosaicking method for producing high quality color images and new image measures for quantifying the performance of demosaicking methods. The proposed demosaicking method consists of two successive steps: an interpolation step that estimates missing color values by exploiting spatial and spectral correlations among neighboring pixels, and a post-processing step that suppresses noticeable demosaicking artifacts by adaptive median filtering.

In many practical face recognition applications such as law enhancement, e-passport, and ID card identification, this assumption, however, may not hold as there is only a single sample per person (SSPP) enrolled or recorded in these systems. Many popular face recognition methods fail to work well in this scenario because there are not enough samples for discriminant learning. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a novel discriminative multimanifold analysis (DMMA) method by learning discriminative features from image patches. First, we partition each enrolled face image into several nonoverlapping patches to form an image set for each sample per person. Then, we formulate the SSPP face …"

In this paper, we propose a new neighborhood repulsed metric learning (NRML) method for kinship verification. Motivated by the fact that interclass samples (without a kinship relation) with higher similarity usually lie in a neighborhood and are more easily misclassified than those with lower similarity, we aim to learn a distance metric under which the intraclass samples (with a kinship relation) are pulled as close as possible and interclass samples lying in a neighborhood are repulsed and pushed away as far as possible, simultaneously, such that more discriminative information can be exploited for verification.

Such tasks arise, for example, in the management of digital video libraries for content-based retrieval and browsing. We develop tools based on camera motion for analyzing and annotating a class of structured video using the low-level information available directly from MPEG-compressed video. In particular, we show that in certain structured settings, it is possible to obtain reliable estimates of camera motion by directly processing data easily obtained from the MPEG format. Working directly with the compressed video greatly reduces the processing time and enhances storage efficiency.

The interpolation process is commonly known as demosaicking. In general, a good demosaicking method should preserve the high-frequency information of imagery as much as possible, since such information is essential for image visual quality. We discuss in this paper two key observations for preserving high-frequency information in CFA demosaicking: (1) the high frequencies are similar across three color components, and 2) the high frequencies along the horizontal and vertical axes are essential for image quality. Our frequency analysis of CFA samples indicates that filtering a CFA image can better preserve high frequencies than filtering each color component separately. This motivates us to design an efficient filter for estimating the …"

Our objective is to regulate the LPP space in a parametric manner and extract useful discriminant information from the whole feature space rather than a reduced projection subspace of principal component analysis. This results in better locality preserving power and higher recognition accuracy than the original LPP method. Moreover, the proposed regularization method can easily be extended to other manifold learning algorithms and to effectively address the small sample size problem. Experimental results on two widely used face databases demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method."

As convexity and convergence of the cost function are not guaranteed, the computational cost for such motion estimation is usually extensive or unpredictable.
