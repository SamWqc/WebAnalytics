Anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been limited by small samples or measurement of single brain regions. Since the neuropsychological deficits in ADHD implicate a network linking basal ganglia and frontal regions, 12 subcortical and cortical regions and their symmetries were measured to determine if these structures best distinguished ADHD.
Method:
Anatomic brain MRIs for 57 boys with ADHD and 55 healthy matched controls, aged 5 to 18 years, were obtained using a 1.5-T scanner with contiguous 2-mm sections. Volumetric measures of the cerebrum, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, amygdala, hippocampus, temporal lobe, cerebellum; a measure of prefrontal cortex; and related right-left asymmetries were examined along with midsagittal area measures of the cerebellum and corpus callosum.

To be specific, we extend adversarial autoencoders by imposing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to align the distributions among different domains, and matching the aligned distribution to an arbitrary prior distribution via adversarial feature learning. In this way, the learned feature representation is supposed to be universal to the seen source domains because of the MMD regularization, and is expected to generalize well on the target domain because of the introduction of the prior distribution.

In many real-world situations, however, the attacker can observe the current location of the defender and can exploit this knowledge to reason about the defender’s future moves. We show that this general modeling framework can be captured using adversarial patrolling games (APGs) in which the defender sequentially moves between targets, with moves constrained by a graph, while the attacker can observe the defender’s current location and his (stochastic) policy concerning future moves. We offer a very general model of infinite-horizon discounted adversarial patrolling games. Our first contribution is to show that defender policies that condition only on the previous defense move (ie, Markov stationary policies) can be arbitrarily suboptimal for general APGs.

The proposed model offers several advantages. First, it minimizes the exact VTV norm whereas standard approaches use a regularized norm. Then, the numerical scheme of minimization is straightforward to implement and finally, the number of iterations to reach the solution is low, which gives a fast regularization algorithm. Finally, and maybe more importantly, the proposed VTV minimization scheme can be easily extended to many standard applications.

Although the problem under the standard low rank assumption is NP-hard, Candès and Recht showed that it can be exactly relaxed if the number of observed entries is sufficiently large. In this work, we introduce a novel matrix completion model that makes use of proximity information about rows and columns by assuming they form communities. This assumption makes sense in several real-world problems like in recommender systems, where there are communities of people sharing preferences, while products form clusters that receive similar ratings. Our main goal is thus to find a low-rank solution that is structured by the proximities of rows and columns encoded by graphs. We borrow ideas from manifold learning to constrain our solution to be smooth on these graphs, in order to implicitly force row and column proximities. Our matrix recovery model is formulated as a convex non-smooth optimization problem, for which a well-posed iterative scheme is provided.

The main solution concept there is the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE), which optimizes the defender's random allocation of limited security resources. However, solely deploying the SSE mixed strategy has limitations. In the extreme case, there are security games where the defender is able to defend all the assets``almost perfectly"" at the SSE, but she still sustains significant loss. In this paper, we propose an approach for improving the defender's utility in such scenarios. Perhaps surprisingly, our approach is to strategically reveal to the attacker information about the sampled pure strategy. Specifically, we propose a two-stage security game model, where in the first stage the defender allocates resources and the attacker selects a target to attack, and in the second stage the defender strategically reveals local information about that target, potentially deterring the attacker's attack plan. We then study how the defender can play optimally in both stages.

As we show in this paper, the follower may have strong incentives to deceitfully imitate the behavior of a different follower type and, in doing this, benefit significantly from inducing the leader into choosing a highly suboptimal strategy. This raises a fundamental question: how to design a leader strategy in the presence of a deceitful follower?

We show that if at the time when a candidate withdraws his candidacy, with some positive probability each voter takes this candidate out of his future consideration, the process converges with probability 1.

In doing so, adaptation takes place in appropriately defined intervals in the game, without disrupting or slowing down the game constantly with intensive decision-making computations, hence improving enjoyment for the player.

Data obfuscation is a prevalent user-centric approach to protecting users’ privacy in such systems: the untrusted entity only receives a noisy version of user’s data. Perturbing data before sharing it, however, comes at the price of the users’ utility (service quality) experience which is an inseparable design factor of obfuscation mechanisms. The entanglement of the utility loss and the privacy guarantee, in addition to the lack of a comprehensive notion of privacy, have led to the design of obfuscation mechanisms that are either suboptimal in terms of their utility loss, or ignore the user’s information leakage in the past, or are limited to very specific notions of privacy which e.g., do not protect against adaptive inference attacks or the adversary with arbitrary background knowledge.
In this paper, we design user-centric obfuscation mechanisms that impose the minimum utility loss for guaranteeing user’s privacy. We optimize utility subject to a joint guarantee of differential privacy (indistinguishability) and distortion privacy (inference error).

This paper presents a criterion called plausible deniability that provides a formal privacy guarantee, notably for releasing sensitive datasets: an output record can be released only if a certain amount of input records are indistinguishable, up to a privacy parameter. This notion does not depend on the background knowledge of an adversary. Also, it can efficiently be checked by privacy tests. We present mechanisms to generate synthetic datasets with similar statistical properties to the input data and the same format. We study this technique both theoretically and experimentally.

This paper proposes a generalized bottom-up update strategy for R-trees. This strategy is motivated by the class of monitoring applications, which are characterized by large volumes of updates, and the increasingly important role of indexing. This update strategy can easily be applied to the members of the family of R-tree-based indexing techniques, as it preserves the index structure and takes into account concurrency control. The strategy improves the robustness of R-trees by supporting different levels of index reorganization—ranging from local to global—during updates, thus using expensive top-down updates only when necessary.

Together with its speed performance, CMOS Current-Mode logic has been rediscovered to allow logic gates implementations which, in contrast to classical VLSI CMOS digital circuits, have the feature of low noise level generation. Thus, CMOS Current-Mode gates can be efficiently used inside analog and mixed-signal ICs, which require a low noise silicon environment. For these reasons, until today, many works and results have been published which reinforce the importance of Current-Mode digital circuits. In the topic of Current-Mode digital circuits, the authors spent a lot of effort in the last six years, and their original results highly enhanced both the modeling and the related design methodologies. Since the fundamental Current-Mode logic building block is the classical differential amplifier, the winning idea, that represents the starting point of the authors’ research, was to change the classical point of view typically followed in the investigation and design of Current-Mode digital circuits. In particular, they properly exploited classical paradigms developed and used in the analog circuit domain (a topic in which one of the authors maturated a great experience).",NUS,EE,Massimo Alioto,"['Massimo Alioto', 'Gaetano Palumbo']",0,5407,"[5407, 3191]"

RAMBO installs new configurations lazily, transferring data from old configurations to new configurations using a background information transfer task. That task handles configurations sequentially, transferring information from each configuration to the next. This paper presents a new algorithm, RAMBO II, that implements a radically different approach to installing new configurations: instead of operating sequentially, the new algorithm reconfigures"" aggressively"", transferring information from old configurations in parallel. This improvement substantially reduces the time necessary to remove obsolete configurations, which in turn substantially increases the fault-tolerance.

We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel …",NUS,EE,Chua Kee Chaing,"['Liang Liu', 'Rui Zhang', 'Chua Kee Chaing']",2,4870,"[1988, 2116, 4870]"

Furthermore, the traffic from such applications are expected to be highly bursty in nature. For such traffic, the allocation of static fixed-bandwidth circuits may lead to the over-provisioning of bandwidth resources in order to meet QoS requirements. Optical burst switching (OBS) is a promising new technique which attempts to address the problem of efficiently allocating resources for bursty traffic. In OBS, incoming data is assembled into bursts at the edges of the network, and when the burst is ready to be sent, resources in the network are reserved only for the duration of the burst. The reservation of resources is typically made by an out-of-band one-way control message which precedes the burst by some offset time. By reserving resources only for the duration of the burst, a greater degree of utilization may be achieved in the network. This book provides an overview of optical burst switching. Design and research issues involved in the development of OBS networks are discussed, and approaches to providing QoS in OBS networks are presented.

Meanwhile its discriminator competes with the generator to identify the generated representation and imposes an additional perceptual requirement-generated representations of small objects must be beneficial for detection purpose-on the generator.

In this way, the learned feature representation is supposed to be universal to the seen source domains because of the MMD regularization, and is expected to generalize well on the target domain because of the introduction of the prior distribution. We proposed an algorithm to jointly train different components of our proposed framework. Extensive experiments on various vision tasks demonstrate that our proposed framework can learn better generalized features for the unseen target domain compared with state of-the-art domain generalization methods.",NTU,EEE,Alex Kot,"['Haoliang Li', 'Sinno Jialin Pan', 'Shiqi Wang', 'Alex Kot']",3,251,"[3058, 1568, 1463, 251]"

Outdoor localization can be solved by the GPS technique, but how to accurately and efficiently localize pedestrians in indoor environments is still a challenging problem. Recent techniques based on WiFi or pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) have several limiting problems, such as the variation of WiFi signals and the drift of PDR. An auxiliary tool for indoor localization is landmarks, which can be easily identified based on specific sensor patterns in the environment, and this will be exploited in our proposed approach. In this work, we propose a sensor fusion framework for combining WiFi, PDR and landmarks. Since the whole system is running on a smartphone, which is resource limited, we formulate the sensor fusion problem in a linear perspective, then a Kalman filter is applied instead of a particle filter, which is widely used in the literature. Furthermore, novel techniques to enhance the accuracy of individual approaches are adopted. In the experiments, an Android app is developed for real-time indoor localization and navigation. A comparison has been made between our proposed approach and individual approaches. The results show significant improvement using our proposed framework.

Commonsense knowledge of sentiment-related concepts is incorporated into the end-to-end training of a deep neural network for sentiment classification. In order to tightly integrate the commonsense knowledge into the recurrent encoder, we propose an extension of LSTM, termed Sentic LSTM.

Attacks using a server could be DoS attack, Phishing attack, E-mail spamming and so on. Sometimes an attacker breaks into a public SSH server and uses it for the above activities. Mostly, it is hard to detect the compromised SSH servers that were used by the attackers. However, by analysing the system logs an organisation can know about the compromises. For an organisation holding several SSH servers, it would be tedious to analyse the log files manually. Also, high-speed networks demand better mechanisms to detect the compromises. In this paper, we detect a compromised SSH session that is carrying out malicious activities. We use flow-based approach and machine learning techniques to detect a compromised session. In a flow-based approach, individual packets are not scrutinised. Hence, it works better on a high-speed network. The data is extracted from a distributed honeypot. The paper also describes the machine learning techniques with appropriate parameters and feature selection technique. A real-time detection model that is tested on a public server is also presented. Several analyses proved that J48 decision tree algorithm and the PART algorithm are best suited for detection of SSH compromises.

XML (Extensible Markup Language) has become the dominant standard for data encoding and exchange on the Internet, including e-business transactions in both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) applications. Given the rapid growth of XML traffic on the Internet, the effective and efficient delivery of XML documents has become an important issue. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the area of XML content-based filtering and routing, which addresses the problem of effectively directing high volumes of XML-document traffic to interested consumers based on document contents.

Abstract A large body of previous models to predict where people look in natural scenes focused on pixel-level image attributes. To bridge the semantic gap between the predictive power of computational saliency models and human behavior, we propose a new saliency architecture that incorporates information at three layers: pixel-level image attributes, object-level attributes, and semantic-level attributes. Object-and semantic-level information is frequently ignored, or only a few sample object categories are discussed where scaling to a large number of object categories is not feasible nor neurally plausible. To address this problem, this work constructs a principled vocabulary of basic attributes to describe object-and semantic-level information thus not restricting to a limited number of object categories. We build a new dataset of 700 images with eye-tracking data of 15 viewers and annotation data of 5,551 segmented objects with fine contours and 12 semantic attributes (publicly available with the paper).

There is a trend to move from conventional libraries to digital libraries. In digital libraries images and text are made available through the Internet for scholarly research. At the same time care is taken to prevent the unauthorized use of the images commercially. In some cases the observer is encouraged to patronize the institution that owns the material. To satisfy both these needs simultaneously the owner needs to use visible watermarking. Visible watermarking is a type of digital watermarking used for protection of publicly available images. We describe a visible watermarking scheme that is applied into the host image in the DCT domain. A mathematical model has been developed for this purpose.

Sri Lanka has witnessed a series of dengue epidemics over the past five years, with the western province, home to the political capital of Colombo, bearing more than half of the dengue burden. Existing dengue monitoring prevention programs are exhausted as public health inspectors (PHIs) cope with increasing workloads and paper-based modes of surveillance and education, characterizing a reactive system unable to cope with the enormity of the problem. On the other hand, the unprecedented proliferation and affordability of mobile phones since 2009 and a supportive political climate have thus far remained unexploited for the use of mobile-based interventions for dengue management.
Objective
To conduct a needs assessment of PHIs in Colombo with respect to their dengue-related tasks and develop a new mobile-based system to address these needs while strengthening existing systems.
Methods
One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 PHIs to a) gain a nuanced, in-depth understanding of the current state of surveillance practices, b) understand the logistical, technological and social challenges they confront, and c) identify opportunities for mobile-based interventions. Quantitative analysis included simple descriptive statistics while qualitative analysis comprised textual analysis of 209 pages of transcripts (or nearly 600 minutes of conversations) using grounded theory approaches.

Equally important is to ensure that the automatically-generated repair D′ is accurate, or makes sense, ie, D′ differs from the “correct” data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improving both data consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) proposed in [6] to specify the consistency of the data, which are able to capture inconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch.

In this paper, the prognostic approaches are described briefly and advanced predictive analytics, namely a parsimonious network based on a fuzzy inference system (PANFIS), is proposed and tested for low speed slew bearing data. PANFIS differs itself from conventional prognostic approaches, supporting online lifelong prognostics without the requirement of a retraining or reconfiguration phase.

We present a protocol that is designed to meet a more practical specification of probabilistic reliability; this gossip-based multicast protocol, called route driven gossip (RDG), can be deployed on any basic on-demand routing protocol. RDG is custom-tailored to ad hoc networks, achieving a high level of reliability without relying on any inherent multicast primitive. We illustrate our RDG protocol by layering it on top of the ""bare"" DSR protocol.

Protein complexes, as molecular machines that integrate multiple gene products to perform biological functions, express the underlying modular organization of protein-protein interaction networks. As such, protein complexes can be useful for interrogating the networks of phenome and interactome to elucidate gene-phenotype associations of diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings We proposed a technique called RWPCN (Random Walker on Protein Complex Network) for predicting and prioritizing disease genes. The basis of RWPCN is a protein complex network constructed using existing human protein complexes and protein interaction network. To prioritize candidate disease genes for the query disease phenotypes, we compute the associations between the protein complexes and the query phenotypes in their respective protein complex and phenotype networks. We tested RWPCN on predicting gene-phenotype associations using leave-one-out cross-validation; our method was observed to outperform existing approaches.

This assumption, however, is impractical as it is often difficult to eliminate the blurring completely in some applications or to know the blurring function completely a priori. In view of this, we present a new soft maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework to perform joint blur identification and HR image reconstruction.

Alignment of scene contents are done at the SP level, which proves to be robust towards rain occlusion and fast camera motion. Two alignment output tensors, ie, optimal temporal match tensor and sorted spatial-temporal match tensor, provide informative clues for rain streak location and occluded background contents to generate an intermediate derain output.

The magnetic field B y is applied in the 2DEG in-plane direction rather than in the perpendicular direction B z, as considered previously. The use of an in-plane field induces a spin current which is more resistant to the D’yakonov type of spin relaxation. It is shown theoretically that the electron energy dispersion is independent of the magnetic vector potential arising from in-plane fields. This enables electron conduction to maintain high conductance, even when multiple barriers are used to enhance the spin polarization of current.

A test is positive if the pool contains at least one defective, and negative if it contains no defectives. This is a sparse inference problem with a combinatorial flavour, with applications in medical testing, biology, telecommunications, information technology, data science, and more. In this monograph, we survey recent developments in the group testing problem from an information-theoretic perspective. We cover several related developments: efficient algorithms with practical storage and computation requirements, achievability bounds for optimal decoding methods, and algorithm-independent converse bounds. We assess the theoretical guarantees not only in terms of scaling laws, but also in terms of the constant factors, leading to the notion of the"" rate"" of group testing, indicating the amount of information learned per test. Considering both noiseless and noisy settings, we identify several regimes where existing algorithms are provably optimal or near-optimal, as well as regimes where there remains greater potential for improvement.

Labeling is usually done manually by human experts (or the users), which is a labor intensive and time consuming process. In the past few years, researchers investigated various forms of semi-supervised learning to reduce the burden of manual labeling. In this paper, we propose a different approach.

It then uses these words to extract a set of documents for each class from a set of unlabeled documents to form the initial training set. The EM algorithm is then applied to build the classifier. The key issue of the approach is how to obtain a set of representative words for each class. One way is to ask the user to provide them, which is difficult because the user usually can only give a few words (which are insufficient for accurate learning). We propose a method to solve the problem. It combines clustering and feature selection. The technique can effectively rank the words in the unlabeled set according to their importance.

The main underlying reason for XSS vulnerabilities is that web markup and client-side languages do not provide principled mechanisms to ensure secure, ground-up isolation of user-generated data in web application code. In this paper, we develop a new approach that combines randomization of web application code and runtime tracking of untrusted data both on the server and the browser to combat XSS attacks. Our technique ensures a fundamental integrity property that prevents untrusted data from altering the structure of trusted code throughout the execution lifetime of the web application. We call this property document structure integrity (or DSI). Similar to prepared statements in SQL, DSI enforcement ensures automatic syntactic isolation of inline usergenerated data at the parser-level. This forms the basis for confinement of untrusted data in the web browser based on a server-specified policy.

Enclave memory is isolated from all other software on the system, even from the privileged OS or hypervisor. While being a promising hardware-rooted building block, enclaves have severely limited capabilities, such as no native access to system calls and standard OS abstractions. These OS abstractions are used ubiquitously in real-world applications.
In this paper, we present a new system called PANOPLY which bridges the gap between the SGX-native abstractions and the standard OS abstractions which feature-rich, commodity Linux applications require. PANOPLY provides a new abstraction called a micro-container (or a “micron”), which is a unit of code and data isolated in SGX enclaves. Microns expose the standard POSIX abstractions to application logic, including access to filesystems, network, multi-threading, multi-processing and thread synchronization primitives. Further, PANOPLY enforces a strong integrity property for the inter-enclave interactions, ensuring that the execution of the application follows the legitimate control and data-flow even if the OS misbehaves. Thus, commodity Linux applications can enhance security by splitting their application logic in one or more microns, or by importing micron-libraries, with little effort.

This paper proposes a generalized bottom-up update strategy for R-trees. This strategy is motivated by the class of monitoring applications, which are characterized by large volumes of updates, and the increasingly important role of indexing. This update strategy can easily be applied to the members of the family of R-tree-based indexing techniques, as it preserves the index structure and takes into account concurrency control. The strategy improves the robustness of R-trees by supporting different levels of index reorganization—ranging from local to global—during updates, thus using expensive top-down updates only when necessary.

Current sampling-based approaches to approximately answer aggregate queries over foreign key joins suffer from the following drawback. All tuples in relations are deemed equally important for answering queries even though, in reality, OLAP queries exhibit locality in their data access. Consequently, they may waste precious real estate by sampling tuples that are not required at all or required very rarely.
In this paper, we introduce icicles, a new class of samples that tune themselves to a dynamic workload. Intuitively, the probability of a tuple being present in an icicle is proportional to its importance for answering queries in the workload. Therefore, an icicle consists of more tuples from a subset of the relation that is required to answer more queries in the workload. Consequently, the accuracy of approximate answers obtained by using icicles is better than a static uniform random sample.

This chapter discusses the efficient mining of XML query patterns for caching. As XML becomes ubiquitous, the efficient retrieval of XML data becomes critical. Research to improve query response time has been largely concentrated on indexing paths and optimizing XML queries. An orthogonal approach is to discover frequent XML query patterns and cache their results to improve the performance of XML management systems. This chapter presents an efficient algorithm called Fast X-Miner, to discover frequent XML query patterns. This chapter develops theorems to prove that only a small subset of the generated candidate patterns needs to undergo expensive tree containment tests. In addition, it demonstrates how the frequent query patterns can be used to improve caching performance.

We consider three well-known models for representing the preferences of the agents: ordinal preferences on single items, the value oracle model, and additive utilities. In each of these models, we establish virtually tight bounds on the approximation ratio that can be obtained by algorithms running in polynomial time.",NUS,CS,Warut Suksompong,"['Pasin Manurangsi', 'Warut Suksompong']",1,5356,"[1488, 5356]"

It became evident that in order to achieve good performance in information extraction, a system needs to be able to recognize names. A separate subtask on NER was created in MUC-6 and MUC-7 (Chinchor, 1998). Much research has since been carried out on NER, using both knowledge engineering and machine learning approaches. At the last CoNLL in 2002, a common NER task was used to evaluate competing NER systems. In this year’s CoNLL, the NER task is to tag noun phrases with the following four classes: person (PER), organization (ORG), location (LOC), and miscellaneous (MISC).

Finding a small sized subgraph that preserves distances between any pair of vertices is a well studied problem. Since in the real world any network is prone to failures, it is natural to study the fault tolerant version of the above problem. Unfortunately, it turns out that there may not always exist such a sparse subgraph even under single edge failure [Demetrescu et al.'08]. However in real applications it is not always the case that a link (edge) in a network becomes completely faulty. Instead, it can happen that some links become more congested which can be captured by increasing weight on the corresponding edges. Thus it makes sense to try to construct a sparse distance preserving subgraph under the above weight increment model where total increase in weight in the whole network (graph) is bounded by some parameter k. To the best of our knowledge this problem has not been studied so far. In this paper we show that given any weighted directed graph with n vertices and a source vertex, one can construct a subgraph of size at most e*(k-1)! 2^ kn such that it preserves distances between the source and all other vertices as long as the total weight increment is bounded by k and we are allowed to only have integer valued (can be negative) weight on edges and also weight of an edge can only be increased by some positive integer.

It establishes that for any pair of infinite sequences A and B, B is Martin-Löf random and A is Martin-Löf random relative to B if and only if the interleaved sequence is Martin-Löf random. This implies that A is relative random to B if and only if B is random relative to A [1–3]. This paper studies the validity of this phenomenon for different notions of time-bounded relative randomness.
We prove the classical van Lambalgen theorem using martingales and Kolmogorov compressibility. We establish the failure of relative randomness in these settings, for both time-bounded martingales and time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.

In such applications, large quantities of state samples obtained via sensors are streamed to a database. Indexes for moving objects must support queries efficiently, but must also support frequent updates. Indexes based on minimum bounding regions (MBRs) such as the R-tree exhibit high concurrency overheads during node splitting, and each individual update is known to be quite costly. This motivates the design of a solution that enables the B § -tree to manage moving objects. We represent moving-object locations as vectors that are timestamped based on their update time. By applying a novel linearization technique to these values, it is possible to index the resulting values using a single B § -tree that partitions values according to their timestamp and otherwise preserves spatial proximity. We develop algorithms for range and nearest neighbor queries, as well as continuous queries. The proposal can be grafted into existing database systems cost effectively. An extensive experimental study explores the performance characteristics of the proposal and also shows that it is capable of substantially outperforming the R-tree based TPR-tree for both single and concurrent access scenarios.

In this paper we study reliability search on uncertain graphs, which we define as the problem of computing all nodes reachable from a set of query nodes with probability no less than a given threshold. Existing reliability-detection approaches are not well-suited to efficiently handle the reliability-search problem.

However, the characteristics of MOS transistors in the subthreshold regime are significantly different from those in strong-inversion. This presents new challenges in design optimization, particularly in complex gates with stacks of transistors. In this paper, we demonstrate a new optimal sizing scheme for subthreshold designs which takes these issues into account. We derive a closed-form solution for the correct sizing of transistors in a stack, both in relation to other transistors in the stack, and to a single transistor with equivalent current drivability. Experimental results show that our framework provides a performance improvement of up to 13.5% over the conventional logical effort method on ISCAS benchmark circuits, while one component circuit demonstrated an improvement of 33.1%.",NTU,EEE,Tony Tae-Hyoung KIM,"['John Keane', 'Hanyong Eom', 'Tony Tae-Hyoung KIM', 'Sachin Sapatnekar', 'Chris Kim']",2,4306,"[3589, 4398, 4306, 353, 531]"

Finally, for use in a CLP system, constraints more general than unit TVPI must be handled, though not necessarily in a complete way.

Such environments are characterized by two challenging features:(a) they have little idle system time to devote on physical design; and (b) there is little, if any, a priori workload knowledge, while the query and data workload keeps changing dynamically. In such environments, traditional approaches to index building and maintenance cannot apply. Database cracking has been proposed as a solution that allows on-the-fly physical data reorganization, as a collateral effect of query processing. Cracking aims to continuously and automatically adapt indexes to the workload at hand, without human intervention. Indexes are built incrementally, adaptively, and on demand. Nevertheless, as we show, existing adaptive indexing methods fail to deliver workload-robustness; they perform much better with random workloads than with others. This frailty derives from the inelasticity with which these approaches interpret each query as a hint on how data should be stored. Current cracking schemes blindly reorganize the data within each query's range, even if that results into successive expensive operations with minimal indexing benefit. In this paper, we introduce stochastic cracking, a significantly more resilient approach to adaptive indexing. Stochastic cracking also uses each query as a hint on how to reorganize data, but not blindly so; it gains resilience and avoids performance bottlenecks by deliberately applying certain arbitrary choices in its decision-making. Thereby, we bring adaptive indexing forward to a mature formulation that confers the …",NUS,CS,Roland Yap,"['Felix Halim', 'Stratos Idreos', 'Panagiotis Karras', 'Roland Yap']",3,991,"[4595, 1831, 6069, 991]"

We show that feature generation together with correlation based feature selection can be used with a variety of machine learning algorithms to give highly accurate translation initiation site prediction.

Our approach has the advantage that it does not require one to devise a special prediction method; rather standard machine learning classifiers are shown to give very good performance on the selected features.

In principle, bounds check instrumentation eliminates the problem, but this introduces high overheads and is further hampered by limited compatibility against un-instrumented code. On 64-bit systems, low-fat pointers are a recent scheme for implementing efficient and compatible bounds checking by transparently encoding meta information within the native pointer representation itself. However, low-fat pointers are traditionally used for heap objects only, where the allocator has sufficient control over object location necessary for the encoding. This is a problem for stack allocation, where there exist strong constraints regarding the location of stack objects that is apparently incompatible with the low-fat pointer approach. To address this problem, we present an extension of low-fat pointers to stack objects by using a collection of techniques, such as pointer mirroring and memory aliasing, thereby allowing stack objects to enjoy bounds error protection from instrumented code. Our extension is compatible with common special uses of the stack, such as alloca, setjmp and longjmp, exceptions, and multi-threading, which rely on direct manipulation of the stack pointer. Our experiments show that we successfully extend the advantages of the low-fat pointer encoding to stack objects.

We implemented Maian, the first tool for specifying and reasoning about trace properties, which employs interprocedural symbolic analysis and concrete validator for exhibiting real exploits. Our analysis of nearly one million contracts flags 34, 200 (2, 365 distinct) contracts vulnerable, in 10 seconds per contract.

However, every individual has a different degree of risk averseness and thus different preferences between risk and returns. Acknowledging that these two factors are inherently conflicting in nature, this paper considers the multi-objective evolutionary optimization of technical trading strategies, which involves the development of trading rules that are able to yield high returns at minimal risk. Popular technical indicators used commonly in real-world practices are used as the building blocks for the strategies, which allow the examination of their trading characteristics and behaviors on the multi-objective evolutionary platform. While the evolved Pareto front accurately depicts the inherent tradeoff between risk and returns, the experimental …",NUS,EE,Abdullah Al Mamun,"['Swee Chiang Chiam', 'Kay Chen Tan', 'Abdullah Al Mamun']",2,1723,"[3893, 4201, 1723]"

The algorithm is modified to handle a map containing unknown information. Based on it, optimal (discrete) paths are incrementally generated with a periodically updated map. Next, accelerations in varying velocities are taken into account in predicting the robot pose and the robot trajectory resulting from a motion command. Obstacle constraints are transformed to suitable velocity limits so that the robot can move as fast as possible while avoiding collisions when needed. Then, to trace the discrete path, the system searches for a waypoint-directed optimized motion in a reduced 1-D translation or rotation velocity space. Various situations of navigation are dealt with by using different strategies rather than a single objective function.

This assumption of quasi-static stability fails to hold when the robot moves at high speed as the inertial forces become significant compared to the static gravitational force. On the other hand, the momentum of the moving structure can be exploited to enhance stability if it is dynamically controlled. This principle was exploited to build a gyroscopically stabilized single-wheeled robot by researchers at Carnegie Melon University (CMU). Our design follows the same principle for stability but uses a different mechanism to effect forward and reverse motion.",NUS,EE,Abdullah Al Mamun,"['Tanveer Saleh', 'Yap Haw Hann', 'Zhu Zhen', 'Abdullah Al Mamun', 'V Prahlad']",3,1723,"[4471, 960, 4193, 1723, 2137]"

To date, many methods have been proposed on evolutionary optimization for both single and multiobjective large scale problems. In the age of Big Data, there is an urge to take evolutionary optimization techniques to the next level for solving problems with even larger scales: thousands and millions of variables. These problems arise in many domains ranging from bioinformatics, to neuroscience and social simulations. In this paper, we investigate the use of EC to solve Big electroencephalography (EEG) data optimization problems with thousands of variables. The optimization problem attempts to identify maximum information that should be kept from a signal while minimizing the artifact. The high level of epistasis inherent in a signal can slow down the evolution.

Training NNs with growth probability based evolution (NN-GP) initializes networks with only one hidden neuron and the networks are allowed to grow until a suitable size. Growing of neurons is not restricted to one hidden neuron at a time as the optimal number of hidden neurons for the NNs might be a few neurons more than what it represents now. If this solution in the search space is far, networks have to add several number of hidden neurons. Growth rate is based on Gaussian distribution thus providing a way to escape local optima. A self-adaptive version (NN-SAGP) with the aim of evolving the growth probability in parallel with NNs during each generation is also proposed.

The proposed technique performs synchronous integration on output signals of the resolver. The integration period is determined from zero crossing detection of the same output signals. The actual envelopes of the signal waveforms are obtained by utilizing the phase relationship of the integrated waveforms with the delayed carrier signal. Due to integration, the noise and disturbance effects are averaged out and the achievable accuracy is improved without applying filters.
